# The Tech Block Podcast 7.31.12

The awesome guys over at [The Tech Block](http://thetechblock.com) had me on their podcast this week. It was a great time. We talked about Apple, Digg, and patent wars.

I also did [an interview](http://thetechblock.com/interview-with-cheddar-app-creator-sam-soffes) with them awhile ago. Their site is so well done. I'm always impressed every time I look at it.

[Give it a listen](http://thetechblock.com/the-tech-block-podcast-7-31-12).
