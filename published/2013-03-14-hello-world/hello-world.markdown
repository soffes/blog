# Hello World

There is a world out there. It's pretty awesome. Today, I stumbled across this picture:

This makes me incredibly sad.

I did something a few months ago that has made me immensely happier day to day. ==I turned off all of my notifications.== No Twitter, email, nothing. I have to manually check all of my apps. This is so great. No more being interrupted at dinner because someone mentioned me in something I don't care about.

You know how you feel your phone vibrate sometimes, but it was just your leg? That quit happening to me. Crazy, right?

So go outside, be present with the people you love when you're with them, or go make something. Staring at your little screen isn't doing anything for you.
