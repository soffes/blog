# My New Favorite Guitar Tuning

```txt
E A E E B E

That is the best tunning ever. I love it. I found [this](http://www.davidcrowderband.com/recordings/chords-cyhu) on the [David Crowder* Band](http://davidcrowderband.com) website. It’s like all of their songs from the Can You Hear Us? CD. I really like playing with this tunning, even in other keys than E.

I just bought B Collision by David Crowder* Band. It’s pretty good. It’s A Collision, only acostic. There’s lots of banjo too, its cool. I think it’s funny that they call it their acostic CD and they still use Reason and other loops and stuff in the background. They rock though. Go buy it, [now](http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewAlbum?id=160579721&s=143441).
