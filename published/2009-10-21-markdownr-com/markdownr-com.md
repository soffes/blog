# Markdownr.com

[Markdownr.com][] is a neat little tool I wrote in a couple of hours for myself. I wanted a quick way to preview [markdown][] (if you don't know what markdown is, you should [go read about it](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown)) since I write all of my blog posts in [markdown][].

It's a pretty simple site. Just type on the left, and see your rendered HTML on the right. All of the parsing is done with [Maruku](http://maruku.rubyforge.org/) in a [Rails Metal](http://weblog.rubyonrails.org/2008/12/17/introducing-rails-metal), so it's real fast.

I wanted to be a good citizen, and give it all away, so you can get all of my code [on GitHub](http://github.com/soffes/markdownr.com). Feel free to fork and improve.
