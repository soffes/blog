# Social Graph API

Google just released their [Social Graph API](http://web.archive.org/web/20080221182117/http://code.google.com/apis/socialgraph/). It sounds amazing. I plan to mess with it a bit for the new samsoffes.com. It just uses [XFN](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XHTML_Friends_Network) and [FOAF](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FOAF) which has been out for years. Itâ€™s really cool. Check out the video.
