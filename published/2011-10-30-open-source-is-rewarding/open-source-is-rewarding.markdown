title: Open Source is Rewarding
categories: development ios
---

I released [SSToolkit](http://sstoolk.it) awhile ago. It's an open source library for doing common things in iOS. It's the overflow of stuff that I use on a daily basis. It's pretty much everything I've ever written that is iOS related that is reusable, open sourced, and released for free.

I recently received this email from a developer using my framework.
