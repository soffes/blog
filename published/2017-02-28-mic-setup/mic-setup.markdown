# Mic Setup

I recently [made a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vi9KaTbGPKA) mentioning my new mic setup and got a few questions about it. Instead of making a video that just mentions tons of links, I thought I'd write it up.

I use a [Heil PR40](http://amzn.to/2mpzNhV) mic. I've used it for a few years now. It's a pretty great mic for making podcasts and screencasts. The boom arm for my desk is a [Heil PL-2T](http://amzn.to/2m9ZXon). This is a great arm. I've seen it used with several other mics too. My mic is attached to the arm with a [Heil PRSM-B Shockmount](http://amzn.to/2mpw6ZI). I also have a [Heil Windscreen](http://amzn.to/2mpWgf5) on it to cut down on breath noise.

The arm mounts into my desk with a [Heil DT-1 Flush Mount](http://amzn.to/2l8v6Je). I have a [Mogami Gold Studio 6' XLR cable](http://amzn.to/2ll2KGP) cable in the arm connected to the mic. I found 6' is just about the perfect length. There's a little extra to work with but not too much. I know the Mogami cables are pretty pricey. From what I've read, it's the only cables you can audibly hear a difference in quality. They're fine cables. Probably doesn't matter that much though.

The cable mounts into a [Neutrik XLR jack](http://amzn.to/2mpIFEt). I always try to buy Neutrik connectors since they are supposed to be the best and finding cables with their connectors usually aren't that much more. This is a really neat jack since it has an XLR connector on both ends. No soldering required!

I used some [digial calipers](http://amzn.to/2mHuma7) to measure the diameter of the jack and flush mount. (I really just wanted an excuse to get some. They were pretty cheap.) The flush mount is exactly 1 1/2" which is nice. The jack is annoyingly some really weird dimension that's slightly less than 1". The base of the faceplate is 1 1/64" so it has to be less than an inch. I ended up using a 15/16" drill bit. I got a small set at Home Depot that had what I needed. Here's [a set on Amazon](http://amzn.to/2mHJ2Gs) that has a few more. (This is [my drill](http://amzn.to/2mpMXvk).)

To mount the jack to the desk, I used some #4 philips wood screws that were less than the depth of my desk that I got at Home Depot. Something like [this](http://amzn.to/2mHr4Ea) will work.

The mic goes into my [Universal Audio Apollo Twin SOLO](http://amzn.to/2lkDvEK) audio interface with another 6' XLR mounted under my desk with some [cable clips](http://amzn.to/2l8HdpF). The interface connects to my [MacBook Pro](http://amzn.to/2mHvLOf) with a [Thunderbolt 2 cable](http://amzn.to/2mBwSzG) and a [Thunderbolt 2 to 3 adapter](http://www.apple.com/shop/product/MMEL2AM/A).

When I'm traveling, I use a [Apogee ONE](http://amzn.to/2mpG4u4) as my interface, take the same mic, and use a [GorillaPod](http://amzn.to/2l8sN99) (with [ball head](http://amzn.to/2mpLXri)) as my mic stand/camera tripod. The Apogee ONE is a great interface. If you want to get this setup, I'd probably recommend getting that over the Apollo since it's a lot cheaper and is more than enough for recording spoken word.

If you're looking for a cheaper alternative, the [Rode Podcaster](http://amzn.to/2m9Uy0J) is a really good option. I used to use it and it was okay. It picks up a lot more room noise than the PR40, but for most podcasts, it's just fine.
