title: I’m Moving to San Francisco
categories: life
---

I've been looking for a real job for awhile now. After [going back to freelancing again](http://samsoff.es/posts/on-my-own-again), I decided I really hate freelancing. Dealing with clients, lining up work, handling money, contracts, etc. All of that stuff sucks. ==I just want to write code== and make cool stuff. Dealing with all of that junk is not fun.

I have flown out to San Francisco for a few interviews and done tons of phone interviews as well. I had a pretty sweet interview at Apple for the iChat engineering team (even though I didn't get the job). Steve Jobs and Jonathan Ive walked right by me while I was eating lunch at Cafe Macs (which is awesome by the way). It was epic.

## What I'm Doing

==I accepted an iOS engineering position at [Scribd](http://scribd.com).==

> Scribd is the largest website for social publishing and reading.
>
> Scribd believes that all your docs want to be shared across the web and all over the world.

You can find out more about Scribd [here](http://www.scribd.com/scribd101) if you want to know more.

They want to make a sweet mobile application for reading. I have a unique experience in making mobile readers ([Bible](http://youversion.com/iphone) and [SocialBooks](http://techcrunch.com/2010/11/11/rethink-books-social/)) so it's a perfect fit!

==My start date is January 3rd==, but I'll be moving the second week of December.

## What About...

**Finding Chesterfield** - Leaving my band ([Finding Chesterfield](http://findingchesterfield.com)) is one of the hardest parts about moving to San Francisco. I'll really missing playing in person with [@mattgrimm](http://twitter.com/8bitmatt). The entire time we've been a band, we have lived in two different cities. We're going to try to keep playing together, but it will be more of a side project than a main focus now. Really hoping to put out a full length album eventually.

**Friends** - That also sucks. I'll definitely miss my Texas (and Oklahoma) friends, but I'm looking forward to making new ones in California.

**My stuff** - I plan on selling or giving away a lot of my furniture (so if you want some stuff and can pick it up, email me). I'll probably just get a small U-Haul trailer and pull it behind my xB with some smaller stuff.

## Yayz

I'm way excited about what Scribd is doing and being a part of it. They have [really sweet offices](http://scribd.com/jobs) too. Biking to work will be awesome. Being near all of my tech heros will be awesome. I can't wait!
