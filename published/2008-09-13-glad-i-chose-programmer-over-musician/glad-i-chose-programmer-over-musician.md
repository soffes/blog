# Glad I Chose Programmer Over Musician

So it turns out that [iPhone app sales are growing twice the rate of iTunes music](http://www.appleinsider.com/articles/08/09/12/iphone_app_sales_growing_at_twice_the_rate_of_itunes_music.html). That rocks for us programmers. I have always enjoyed music (and [making my own music](http://samsoff.es/music)), but spent more time on computers because I was never the best. I was always an average player and people were more impressed with stuff I would make on the computer.

Especially as I got older, I could make money doing a website, but playing drums in my room for hours on end just left me sweaty. I still love music, but I'm glad I chose the more monetary of the two for a profession.
