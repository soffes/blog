# Logic Pro Studio is Awesome

So I bought [Logic Studio](http://web.archive.org/web/20071014203346/http://apple.com/logicstudio). It's awesome! I haven't even scratched the surface yet. It's awesome to know that you have all of the tools right in front of you to make any sound you could possibly think of.

I have had the [Behringer FCB1010](http://web.archive.org/web/20071014203346/http://www.behringer.com/FCB1010/) for awhile. It's a [MIDI](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midi) controller with 10 stomp boxes and 2 expression pedals. I have only spent a few hours playing with [MainStage](http://web.archive.org/web/20071014203346/http://www.apple.com/logicstudio/mainstage/) with it. It's going to be awesome! I am really excited about having an awesome guitar rig.

I think I am going to sell all of my analoge pedals, pedal board, power supplies, and Mbox. I'll probably just buy a better audio interface and save the rest. I've been having latency issues. I need to test my setup with some different interfaces.

Yay Logic Studio!
