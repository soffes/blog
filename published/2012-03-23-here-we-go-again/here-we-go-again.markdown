# Here We Go Again

If you've kept up with me at all the last couple of years, you already know what this post is about. ==April 5th will be my last day at Synthetic.== It has been absolutely fantastic working here. I have had an amazing time with everyone. I got to be a part of some really great stuff in my time at Synthetic. Everyone I got the privilege of working with will definitely be missed.

### What's Next

==I'll be dedicating all of my time now to some products I can't wait to show you.== My goal is to stay on my own for as long as possible. Hopefully some of the products I'll be releasing will make enough money to pay my bills so I can continue to keep doing this.

When I run out of money, I'll figure something out. Contract work will probably be a temporary means of building back up my cash buffer (or cash cache if you will) so I can get back to my own stuff. (That said, I'm not looking for work.)

I'm really excited and nervous about the coming months. It's a dream come true to be able to do this. Thank you to everyone for your encouragement and support.

By the way, ==I have [something small](http://useshares.com) launching soon.== Exciting times!
