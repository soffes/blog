# Moving to Louisville

**Update:** [Scratch that, I'm staying in Oklahoma City](/post/scratch-that-im-staying-in-oklahoma-city)

Now that I don't have a "job" I have freedom to live where ever I want, which is awesome. I will really miss all of my Oklahoma friends, my house, and the band I play in.

I am looking forward to a lot of old friends in Louisville. I love it here.

It's kinda funny how this all worked out. I didn't plan on moving actually. My mom is moving to Northern California this summer for an awesome job. I'll be moving back to Louisville to live in her house so she doesn't have to sell it. I'll be renting my house out to some friends in Edmond. It all worked out perfectly.

I will be continuning my [freelance work](http://iturndreamsintosoftware.com) exactualy like I was in Oklahoma. I will probably move after [WWDC](http://developer.apple.com/wwdc) this summer.
