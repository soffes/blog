# ExpressionEngine Kills My PageRank

> We’ve detected that your 404 (file not found) error page returns a status of 200 (Success) in the header.

That is what Google says kills my PageRank. ExpressionEngine says that this is feature. Routing all of my not found pages to my home page and returning a success error code. I asked if they would fix it and they said no.

Solution: write my own engine. I’ve already started. This will make the 8th engine I’ve used and the 10th design. I like making web sites.
