# Everlapse

[![Everlapse](icon.png)](http://everlapse.com)

Today, my co-workers at [Seesaw](https://seesaw.co) and I launched a little side project called [Everlapse](http://everlapse.com). It's a fun app for sharing life, frame by frame.

It's kind hard to explain. Checkout the [home page](http://everlapse.com) to see it in action.

Everlapse started out as a hack week project. We spent about 3 weeks on this project from idea to submission to the [App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/everlapse/id658120886?ls=1&mt=8). It's always super exciting starting something new and finishing it quickly.

Anyway, **[check it out](http://everlapse.com)** and [let me know what you think](http://twitter.com/soffes).

By the way, [Caleb](http://twitter.com/calebd) and I threw up a [developer site](http://developer.everlapse.com). Make something cool.
