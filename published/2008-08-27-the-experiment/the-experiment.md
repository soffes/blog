# The Experiment

So I put up one of the songs I had been working on because people on Twitter kept asking to hear what I was working on. I finally put it up [on my site](http://samsoff.es/music) and got a huge response on Twitter.

I think it's pretty good. It's relaxing at least. I was looking through my old recordings and found some more ideas I had started. I think I'll try to get together a few of my more developed ideas and put out a CD (called [The Experiment](http://samsoff.es/music)). Sounds fun to me. Besides, I like making stuff people enjoy using/listening to.

I'll be posting all of my music on my blog and [over here](http://samsoff.es). You can subscribe to my [RSS feed](http://samsoff.es/rss) if you want. [Send me some email](http://samsoff.es/about) and let me know what you think.
