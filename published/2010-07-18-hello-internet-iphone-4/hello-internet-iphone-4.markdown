# Hello Internet: iPhone 4

So I have a lot of thoughts on various topics. I was joking with [someone](http://twitter.com/mattgrimm) that I should start making videos for all of my rants... so I did. I'm going to call these videos ==Hello Internet==. I'll be super biased and slightly arrogant because I am the most awesome person ever.

Thoughts on the iPhone 4 antenna debacle.
