# Those Were The Days

I was just talking with my good friend, [Matt Grimm](http://twitter.com/8bitmatt). We used to be in a band together called [Finding Chesterfield](http://findingchesterfield.com). It was some of the best times in my life.

I wrote [a post in 2008 about choosing programming over music](/glad-i-chose-programmer-over-musician). I remember making a conscious decision in high school to pursue programming over music. Mainly because I sucked at music and was way better at programming at the time (by my standards anyway).

==It's interesting that the best times in my life have nothing to do with programming, design, making products, or any of the stuff that consumes my life today.== I haven't even touched my drums or a guitar in months. It's funny how things change.

Anyway, this is the beginning of Finding Chesterfield. I drove up from Dallas to Oklahoma City (where Matt lives) to spend the weekend playing music. We ended up writing like 5 songs. It was awesome.

So I started driving up almost every weekend to play. Here's the first recording we made, Gonna Be Okay: (The autotune on this one is so over the top. Don't worry, they get better.)

Here's my favorite early recording, Where We Stand:

Both of those made it on the album. Recording the CD was super fun. We spent a week in Dallas with Luis Dubuc of [The Secret Handshake](http://thesecrethandshake.net). It was awesome. ==You can download the final versions of these two and three other songs [here](http://soffes-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/music/FindingChesterfield-AThreeDayWalkEP.zip).== You can also listen to it [on SoundCloud](http://soundcloud.com/soffes/sets/a-three-day-walk-ep).

We also recorded a video of us playing my favorite song on the CD, Give It Back:

We also recorded [a making of video](https://vimeo.com/13116318).

After the EP, we started working on a new song that we never finished. Here's the rough demo of Texas:

This is probably my favorite thing that we worked on together. It's a shame we never finished it. Maybe someday.

Anyway, it was a really awesome time in my life. I hope that I get the opportunity to do something like this again.

I'd love to hear what you think. Let me know [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/soffes).
