# The East Wing â€” Part 3

[Tim Smith](http://ttimsmith.com) was gracious enough to have me on [The East Wing](http://5by5.tv/eastwing) for the third time. We talked about what I've been up to, [Picking Good Clients](/picking-good-clients), [Motivation](/motivation), and [Execute iOS](http://executeios.com).

[Give it a listen.](http://5by5.tv/eastwing/81) We also recorded [an after dark](http://5by5.tv/afterdark/436) right after.
