# Shake!

So I was playing with the shake effect in [Script.aculo.us](http://script.aculo.us/) (an AJAX library). It will shake back-and-forth when you enter a bad password (like in OS X).

Anyway, click on my blue tie (up above) or here for a little surprise.

Adding all that AJAX and Adsense slows down my site a little bit, sorry.

**Update 2021-01-02:** I removed this effect back in 2006, but I kept this post. Funny to see how excited I was about a little JavaScript visual effect.
