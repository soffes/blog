# Apple Boot Camp Public Beta1

Apple has just released Boot Camp. It lets you dual boot easily Mac OS X and Windows XP (Pro or Home with SP2). This is just a beta version of the software. It will be included in the new OS 10.5 Leopard. All you need is an Intel Mac and a Windows XP CD.

I am really looking forward to this. If Apple added a right click to the MacBook Pro, everyone would want to buy one. Personally, as soon as Adobe releases Photoshop and Studio 8 (perviously by Macromedia), I will be buying a 20" iMac. I think I'll keep my little 12" PowerBook G4 around. It's perfect for note taking and checking my mail on the road.
