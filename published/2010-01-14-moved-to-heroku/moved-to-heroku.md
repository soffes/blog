# Moved To Heroku

I posted a [screencast on Heroku](/post/easy-deployment-with-heroku) a few months ago. Since then, [my company](http://tastefulworks.com) has moved all of their stuff to [Heroku](http://heroku.com). It has been working really great for us.

I've had my blog [on GitHub pages](/post/new-blog-on-github-and-jekyll) for awhile. I recently came across a [good article](http://jstorimer.com/2009/12/29/jekyll-on-heroku.html) on running [Jekyll](http://github.com/mojombo/jekyll) from the [Ruby5 podcast](http://ruby5.envylabs.com/episodes/42-episode-40-january-8-2010). It was really easy to get setup. So far, I'm a fan of my new setup.

I'm still working on my [Rails 3 version of my blog](http://github.com/soffes/soff.es/tree/rails3) when I have time. Lately, I've been playing a lot of music and occasionally dabbling with [Markdownr.com](http://markdownr.com) due to a recent spike in traffic ([thanks to @defunkt](http://twitter.com/defunkt/status/7491983993)).
