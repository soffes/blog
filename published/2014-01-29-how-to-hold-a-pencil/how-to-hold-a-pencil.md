# How to Hold a Pencil

Recently, [I was on How to Hold a Pencil](http://www.howtoholdapencil.com/episode/010/). It was a good time. How to Hold a Pencil is a podcast for people starting out in the design or development world.

We talked about [How to Learn](/how-to-learn), [Motivation](/motivation), how I got started, and what I'm up to now.

[Give it a listen](http://www.howtoholdapencil.com/episode/010/)!
