# New Contact Information

I just got a new phone number. I figured it would be better to have a local number in Oklahoma instead of keep my Louisville number.

My new number is **405 365 4440**. My old number doesn’t work anymore.

Moving into my new apartment was awesome. I love it here so far. I can’t wait to get started tomorrow at [LifeChurch.tv](http://web.archive.org/web/20080109223404/http://lifechurch.tv/)!

By the way, download my vcard.
