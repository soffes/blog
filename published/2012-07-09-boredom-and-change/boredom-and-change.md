# Boredom & Change

I've been doing iOS since the day it was announced. It's been great. I have to say though ==it's getting old==.

Most everything is download stuff from the network, store it in Core Data, and display it in a table view. Make a few custom controls here and there or some fun animations. That part is fun, but that's a small part of it.

I think I'm getting over just programming in general. I love creating stuff, don't get me wrong. Just starting to realize that typing all day isn't the only way to achieve the good feeling that I created something.

Lately, I've been doing lots of Ruby. It's been a fun change. ==What's even more exciting is building a product.== Doing marketing, support, design, and everything else required to build a company is thrilling. I still love programming. I'm sure I'll keep doing it for a long while to come.

With this line of thinking, I did something crazy today. ==I bought an Android device.== I was shocked. Google keeps saying the [Nexus 7](https://play.google.com/store/devices/details?id=nexus_7_8gb&feature=single-wide-banner) is really smooth (which is hilarious they are finally admitting that scrolling on the previous devices is less than acceptable) so I preordered one.

I figured I'd give it a shot. Mainly to test [Cheddar](http://cheddarapp.com) in the browser. Also, I'm not totally opposed to writing an Android app anymore. You can count the number of beautiful Android apps on one hand (so I've been told). It sounds like a fun challenge to make a beautiful Android app. Definitely not planning on making one anytime soon, but we'll see.

==Besides learning new things is good.== The future is exciting. Don't get me wrong, I'm not going to stop doing iOS anytime soon. I'm also way excited to work on Cheddar for Mac.

**Update 06/22/2013:** I no longer own Cheddar. [More info](http://soff.es/parting-ways-with-cheddar).
