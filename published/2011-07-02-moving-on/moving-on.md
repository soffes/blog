# Moving On

Yesterday, Scribd submitted the app I've been working on for the last 6 months. It's been really great working with everyone. It was also my last day at Scribd. Now that the project is done, I'm moving on to something else.

## What Will You Be Doing?

==Nothing!== Taking some time off to rest after working crazy hours to finish the project. I have a pretty exciting contract gig I'll be starting soon that will last for a few months that will be a lot of fun. I have a few interviews at some pretty cool places, but I'm not in a hurry to get a real job again.

## Haven't You Done This Before?

Sigh, yes. This will be the third time I have moved to being a full-time contractor. Yes, I hated it in the past. Yes, I've said that I won't hate it this time around before. Yes, I probably will hate it in a few months :) Anyway, I'm excited. I want to focus on my [own projects](http://cheddarapp.com) more this time around.

It's funny how not a big deal this is to me. I've changed jobs and moved a lot lately the last few years. It's almost being normal. Hopefully I'll settle down one of these days. For now, I plan on staying in San Francisco for a bit. We'll see what happens on that front though.
