# Linus Torvalds on git

Just watched this video on YouTube. I thought it was really interesting. I've never heard Torvalds speak before. He's a funny guy. I liked how he told people to google how to use git if they didn't know. Good stuff.

If you're not already using git for source control management (or not using source control management at all, which you should be doing anyway) you should check out git. There are tons of great resources for getting started on [git's website](http://git-scm.com/) and in [GitHub's guides](http://github.com/guides).
