# Onward

I'm no stranger to change. Most people are change averse. I embrace it. ==Change is the only way to move forward.== If you followed me for any time at all, you can start laughing at how predictable this post is.

==Today is my last day at Seesaw.== Seesaw is the second longest job I've had coming in at just 14 business days short of a year. ==I'm [getting married on Saturday](http://samandellen.com)== and taking three weeks off for my honeymoon and for ==our move to San Francisco==. Like I said, bring on the change.

I figured it was best to just be up front with Seesaw and let them know I was planning to leave soon. I'd hate to waste their time and money with three weeks off only to leave soon after. We both agreed it was best to leave before. The wonderful folks at Seesaw and I are on great terms.

## What Now?

==I'm going to [be a contractor](http://hire.soff.es) for a bit.== I've told friends to never let me do this again because I hate contracting. I think this time will be different (like I always say). I'm only taking on clients I'm excited to work with.

Right now, I have a few month retainer with [Over](http://madewithover.com). It's two guys I know from Kentucky. I already wrote a library for them for working with the [Path API](http://techcrunch.com/2013/08/12/path-opens-its-api/). (We hope to open source it at some point.) We have a lot of other stuff on the list. I really like working with images, so this should be a lot of fun.

I'm really excited to have time to work on all of my little projects like [Roon](http://roon.io) and a few other things in the pipeline. Redesigning [Shares](http://getsharesapp.com) for iOS 7, supporting iPhone 5, and bringing it to iPad is also on my list.

## Honeymoon

Our wedding is on Saturday. I'm super excited for it! I'm going to write a post about all of the neat stuff we did for the wedding after things settle down a bit. On Monday, movers come to pick up all of our stuff and take it to San Francisco.

We're going to drive from Louisville to San Francisco. Ellen hasn't seen much of the United States, so we're going to hit up a lot of neat places along the way. Here's a rough list:

* St. Louis Arch
* Mount Rushmore
* Oklahoma City
* Dallas
* Grand Canyon
* Los Angeles

Then we'll take Highway 1 up to San Francisco. That's a ton of driving, but it should be a ton of fun. If we get sick of driving, we can just head straight to San Francisco.

After we arrive, we're going to Airbnb until we can find an apartment. We decided to move even though I'm not working at Seesaw since we both wanted to live in San Francisco. It's a great place to be. I have a ton of thoughts on that subject, so I'll save that for another time.

## Let's Go

This is the most exciting time in my life. I'm so excited for my wedding! Plus, there's the honeymoon, moving, changing jobs, and having a lot more free time.

Life is good.
