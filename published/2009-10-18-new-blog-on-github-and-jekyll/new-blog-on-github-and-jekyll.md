# New Blog on GitHub and Jekyll

So today I moved my blog from [Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org) on [SliceHost](http://slicehost.com) to [Jekyll][] on [GitHub](http://github.com). It only took a two hours to figure it out and move everything over.

The main reason for moving to the new setup (besides the fact that I love redoing my blog for some reason) was being able to manage all of my posts via [Markdown][] files locally, then pushing then up with [Git](http://git-scm.com) when I had a good version.[Jekyll][] lets me do this easily and quickly.

I'm going to give this a shot for now. I don't really want to write a blogging platform, even thought I've written a ton. I just like programming. Now that I have more projects than I have time for, I'm looking for something simple that I can simply post with. When I roll my own solution, I end up working on it for a few hours each time instead of just writing my post.

Anyway, enjoy the new blog and feel free to checkout the [source code on GitHub](http://github.com/soffes/soffes.github.com).
