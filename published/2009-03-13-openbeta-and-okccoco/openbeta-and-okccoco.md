# OpenBeta and OKCCoCo

Tonight I went to [OpenBeta](http://openbeta.extendedbeta.com) with some friends from work. I met a lot of super cool people too. It's always cool to connect with people in person that you have only met via [Twitter](http://twitter.com/soffes).

OpenBeta is an [unconference](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unconference) focused on web development, software development, and design. There were over 200 people there. It's awesome to have such a community here in Oklahoma City. I always love meeting other iPhone developers in person. So far, I've only met two.

Another really cool thing happening here in Oklahoma City is [OKCCoco](http://okccoco.com/). OKCCoCo is the Oklahoma City Coworking Collaborative:

> The space where designers, developers, entrepreneurs and technology enthusiasts meet, work, share, create, and innovate.

You can rent out a desk or office in the collaborative office. It's really neat to see others in the development/design community all wanting to connect and work in a collaborative environment. Personally, I don't think I'd work there unless I had an employee or partner, but it is a really great thing for some people.

I'm super pumped to be in a city that has a growing development community. I know Louisville, KY (where I moved from in 2008) didn't have a community like this. Good stuff. Keep it up OKC guys!
