# Music Podcast and Years

So [@aadom](http://twitter.com/Aadom) on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/soffes) said it would be a good idea to podcast all of my music for [The Experiment](http://samsoff.es/music). I thought that sounded like a good plan, so I did. You can check out the [podcast feed](http://feeds2.feedburner.com/samsoffes/the-experiment) or the [music area](http://samsoff.es/music) to subscribe.

I also put up a new song I've been working on for years up tonight called ==Years==. This is the song that I play when I pick up a random guitar in a guitar store or I'm just bored sitting around my apartment picking away mindlessly. I think it's turning out nicely so far. I'm digging the piano a lot. [Give it a listen](http://samsoff.es/music).

**Update:** I no longer maintain this podcast. You still see all of the music on [SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/soffes) though.
