# Why the Facebook IPO Matters

Facebook's IPO was today. Unless you're living in a cave, you already knew this. Facebook's IPO is a big deal.

A bunch of people not too far from here just became millionaires (or will be very shortly). All of these now super rich Facebook employees are going to spend this money. Housing near the Facebook office has been going up and up in price. Buying a ridiculous house is where I'd start, but that's only a few million.

What would I do after I buying a sweet house and a [Tesla](http://teslamotors.com/models)? Invest in some smart kids making something cool in San Francisco. The bubble is just getting started.
