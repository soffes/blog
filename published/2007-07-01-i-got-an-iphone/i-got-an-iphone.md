# I got an iPhone

It is so amazing. I love getting email on my phone. CoverFlow in the iPod is quite possibly the most amazing thing I have ever seen. The keyboard is also really nice. It's really easy to type on. Everything you've seen in [the videos](http://apple.com/iphone) is as easy as they say it is. I really love this phone. It is so much more than just a phone. I am actually typing this note on my iPhone. I am using the real facebook too, I don't have too use that mobile version or anything. Buy an iPhone, you won't regret it.
