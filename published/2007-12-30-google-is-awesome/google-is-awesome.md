# Google Is Awesome

I saw this on Digg. It's some engineer that works at Google giving a 50 minute presentation on how their data center works. They have hundreds of thousands of machines that run their filesystem (Google File System or GFS). They can recover from one machine failing in less than 2 seconds.It's pretty crazy. You should check this out. The first few minutes are a bit slow, but it gets awesome pretty fast.
