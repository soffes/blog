# Swift

Yesterday, I did an interview [on Venture Beat](http://venturebeat.com/2014/06/03/a-programmers-view-of-apples-new-swift-language/) about Swift, Apple's new programming language. Here's an excerpt:

> I think one of the best parts about Swift is a lot of the simplicity they were able to bring to the language due to not being built on top of C. Explaining Objective-C to someone who has never programmed is pretty difficult. You have to explain all of the exceptions to rules and get into pretty deep computer science topics right from the start. Swift letâ€™s you bypass all of that and just get into the code.

In short, ==I'm a big fan of Swift==. Checkout the [full article](http://venturebeat.com/2014/06/03/a-programmers-view-of-apples-new-swift-language/).
