# I am Addicted to Redoing my Blog

It is sad how much I redo my blog. I usually redo it more than I actually blog. Then I get it going and then get an idea for a new one and stop on the old one. So here is my new attempt at my blog. I think I am switching off [Tumblr](http://tumblr.com) as much as I love it. I'll leave my old one up at [soffes.tumblr.com](http://soffes.tumblr.com/) incase you're still interested.

I still need to write some stuff to do rss and such. Hopefully I'll get to that real soon. Sorry for breaking your feed readers again.

Enjoy the new look. I doubt it will be around long.
