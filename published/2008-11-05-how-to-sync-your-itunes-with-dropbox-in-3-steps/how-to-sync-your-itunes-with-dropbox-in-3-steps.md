# How To Sync Your iTunes With Dropbox in 3 Steps

So I have been trying to solve the problem of having my iTunes on all of my computers for a long time. I tried taking my MacBook Pro with me and mounting it in target disk mode, USB powered hard drives, and [rsync](http://samba.anu.edu.au/rsync/) (which was frustrating and I ended up giving up on that one).

I’ve been using [Dropbox][] (a really sweet file syncing service) for a while now. It’s really hand for syncing files between my computers seamlessly. The [MobileMe](http://me.com) iDisk is super slow and doesn’t support PCs (not that I care about them though). I mainly used [Dropbox][] to sync all of [desktop wallpapers](http://interfacelift.com) between my computers or to transfer a file quickly. We also use it at work to share a file quickly.

A few weeks ago I started syncing my iTunes library between my computers with [Dropbox][] instead of using my portable hard drive. I had to up my space to 50GB (only $9.99 a month). It’s been awesome! It’s really easy to setup too.

Before you do any of this, I would strongly recommend backing up your entire library somewhere safe by just coping the entire iTunes folder. For my nothing happened, but just to be safe, I would do it anyway.

1. ==Move your iTunes folder to your Dropbox folder.== This will probably take a really long time. For me it took about 8 hours.
2. ==Launch iTunes while holding the option key (shift on Windows).==
3. ==Click choose library== and choose your iTunes library folder in your Dropbox.

That’s it. You’re done. After a ton of waiting, you’ll be good to go.

Some important things to note, you’ll want to make sure you ==do not use your library on more than one computer at the same time==. It will just make headaches for you. I had to go without my music for almost a whole day because it was uploading for a really long time and then had to download on my other computer for a really long time.

You should also make sure you have enough disk space for your library on all of your computers that you use [Dropbox][] on. If you don’t it will make for some fun issues.

Feel free to [email me](http://samsoff.es/about) if you have questions. Enjoy.

**Update 09/03/2010:** Syncing between Macs and PCs does not work due to the way they store file paths in the library file. If you're syncing between the same system, it works fine.
