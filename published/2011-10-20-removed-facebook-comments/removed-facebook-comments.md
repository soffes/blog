# Removed Facebook Comments

Sorry if you left some comments. I appreciate it, but it wasn't really a good solution. They weren't that pretty, loaded slow, and didn't notify me when people posted. I had no way to track comments on my posts.

I might build something, but now, I'll just go back to no comments. If you want to leave a comment or ask a question, I'm [@soffes on Twitter](http://twitter.com/soffes). You can always [email me](mailto:sam@soff.es) too.
