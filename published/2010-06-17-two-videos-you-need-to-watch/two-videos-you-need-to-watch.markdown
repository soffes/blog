# Two Videos You Need to Watch

Here are two talks from [RailsConf 2010](http://en.oreilly.com/rails2010). You can see all of the keynotes [on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/view_play_list?p=393ECE649BB3813D). I haven't ever gone to a RailsConf, but I hope to sometime.

==Even if you aren't a developer, these videos are totally worth your time.==

#### Yehuda Katz

This is a short 26 minute talk by [Yehuda Katz](http://yehudakatz.com/) ([@wycats](http://twitter.com/wycats)) on development in general. This is so inspiring. He talks about doing the impossible and just getting stuff done. Really worth your time.

#### Gary Vaynerchuck

This is an hour talk by [Gary Vaynerchuk](http://garyvaynerchuk.com/) ([@garyvee](http://twitter.com/garyvee)). He talks about business to a group of developers and his views in general on social media and our culture. Really interesting and inspiring. It's long, but worth it. (He cusses a lot, just fyi.)
