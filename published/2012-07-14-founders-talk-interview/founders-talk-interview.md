# Founders Talk Interview

I recently had the honor of being on [Founders Talk](http://5by5.tv/founderstalk/38). [Adam Stacoviak](http://twitter.com/adamstac) and I talked for an hour and forty minutes about how I got started programming, my journey through the years, Hipstamatic, starting Nothing Magical, and Cheddar.

We talk about some pretty personal stuff that greatly shaped my life. I'm pretty excited to look back and listen to this in several years. Anyway, [give it a listen](http://5by5.tv/founderstalk/38) if you're interested.

**Update 08/07/12:** [Founders Talk Part 2](http://soff.es/founder-talk-part-2)
