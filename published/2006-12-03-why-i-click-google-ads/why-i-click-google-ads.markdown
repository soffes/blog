# Why I Click on Google Ads

I click on Google Ads, a lot. Why in the world would I click on Google ads? I click them for many reasons (there’s really only two, but many sounds better). When you click a ad, the person with the ad on their site gets money. I like [Digg.com](http://digg.com) and I like Kevin Rose, so I click on Google ads to help them out.

Google ads are content specific (so if you’re looking at guitars, there will be guitar Google ads). Some times I’ll see one that looks interesting and click on them just to check out what someone is selling in relation to what I’m looking at. Just a thought.
