# Parting Ways with Execute iOS

It makes me incredibly sad to say, I am no longer involved with [Execute iOS](http://executeios.com). Josh Long now owns it all now. The course, app, website, etc. is all his now. Without going into too much detail, I decided it was best to part ways and focus on other things. Maybe one day I’ll post the whole story.

It was fun while it lasted.
