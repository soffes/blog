As of September 1st, I will be working at [Synthetic](http://heysynthetic.com), the makers of [Hipstamatic](http://hipstamatic.com/)! You may remember, [I was contracting there](http://samsoff.es/posts/hipstamatic), but now I'm no longer a freelancer and a full time employee. My title will be Lead iOS Engineer. I'm way excited. We are working  on some really, really exciting stuff.

It's really cool to be a part of something instead of a hired gun. The decision was easy. This is an amazing place to work. I really can't wait for our releases coming up! We will blow some minds.

If you wanna work on some awesome too, we're hiring iOS and Rails engineers. Email me: [sam@synth.tc](mailto:sam@synth.tc)
