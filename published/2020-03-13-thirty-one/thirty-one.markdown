# Thirty-One

Today, I’m 31 years old. Crazy.

That seems like such an old age. I remember thinking when I was 22 that I better get everything done by the time I’m 30 since my career or whatever will be over then. Hah, such a kid.

[Last year](https://soffes.blog/thirty), I wrote this:

I think I did a pretty good job of this last year. I think it had some of the highest highs and lowest lows of any year, but overall it was pretty great. ==I’m just trying to focus on the highs. No point in focusing on the negatives.==

I spent a lot of time hiking, scuba diving, taking photos, and building things. In December, Ellen and I bought a house in San Francisco. Working on renovations, home automation, and other house things is some of the most fun I’ve had in a long time. ==I really like using my creativity of things other than software.==

That said, this coming Tuesday I start a new job at [GitHub](https://github.com). I’m really excited about it! I think there will be a lot more making than my previous job. ==All I want to do is make things.== Super excited to have more of an opportunity to do this with software again.

## Goals

I really like goals. When I was very young, my mom encouraged me to set goals.

I remember one of the first goals I set was buying this $20 creepy crawly machine. It had these little metal plates (like 3” × 5” or something), you’d squirt little bottles of liquid in them, put them in the machine (that was basically just a box with a light bulb in it), and then you get’s these flexible, rubbery bug things out. So silly.

I’m not sure why ~8 year old me really wanted this. Anyway, I saved up and got it and it was so satisfying. I don’t remember playing with it that much. I had a good time putting it together and making the little things but didn’t really want to play with them after. Hah.

Anyway, let’s set some goals for this year.

**Go backpacking a bunch.** I did [some](https://soffes.blog/lost-coast) [last](https://soffes.blog/tahoe-rim-trail) [year](https://soffes.blog/california-riding-and-hiking-trail) and it was great. I hope to do a lot more while I’m 31. Exercise and nature. Fantastic.

**Go diving at least a few times.** I only did a [few](https://soffes.blog/diving-in-cozumel) trips last year compared to previous years. I’d really like to keep it up and go more often.

**Make some videos.** I used to [vlog a lot](https://youtube.com/samsoffes). I was thinking about making a bunch of videos of house projects or other things. I’d like to start making some. I just need to slow down and do it.

**Learn new things.** I really like learning. Lately, I’ve been learning a lot about house stuff. I’d love to keep learning in that area but also more about design, working with people, and whatever else to help me be better.

**Lose some weight.** I lost 20lbs+ last year and gained most of it back. I’d really like to figure out some sort of sustainable way to get to my target weight. I have some ideas I’m excited about.

I have a few more personal goals, but this is a good list for now.

Let’s stay positive out there.
