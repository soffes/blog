# Announcing Cheddar

[Cheddar](http://cheddarapp.com) is an app I started working on November of last year. From the start, it was a really exciting project, but I never had much time to devote to it. Now that I [don't have a job](http://samsoff.es/posts/here-we-go-again), I've been focusing on it full time.

Cheddar will be the first [Nothing Magical](http://nothingmagical.com) product that I launch. I'm massively excited to release it so you can see what I've been up to. It should come out in a couple of weeks. I have a lot of other ideas that I can't wait to work on, but more on that later.

Check out [Cheddar](http://cheddarapp.com). I made a little video to tell you about Cheddar. Head on over and [watch it](http://cheddarapp.com).

**Update 06/22/2013:** I no longer own Cheddar. [More info](http://soff.es/parting-ways-with-cheddar).
