# Custom Controls in Footage

I've been working on app called [Footage](http://footageapp.com) with my good friend [Drew Wilson](https://twitter.com/drewwilson) (we made [Roon](https://roon.io) together). Footage is a video editor app he's been working on for awhile. Drew hired me to make the effects system and to come up with a way for some designer friends to make effects.

We decided to make another Mac app called *Footage Composer*. It's been a lot of fun and there are definitely some big challenges with this project. ==Mac development is hard.==

I asked Drew if I could show off some of the stuff I've been working on and he was all for it.

## Curves

Here's a demo of the curves control:

==This is probably the most complicated thing I've worked on in a super long time.== I'm really proud of it.

## Gradient

Another really fun control was the gradient control. Here's a quick demo:

That color picker library is [BFColorPickerPopover](https://github.com/DrummerB/BFColorPickerPopover). There's still a few things to polish up with it, but overall I'm really happy with it!

Thanks for watching! Let me know what you think [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/soffes).
