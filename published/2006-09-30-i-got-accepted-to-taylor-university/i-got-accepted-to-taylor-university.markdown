# I GOT ACCEPTED TO TAYLOR UNIVERSITY!!!!

Yay I got into college today!!! YAY! I'm soo happy! It is in Upland, IN about an hour north of indi. It's the number one computer science Christian college. Upland is a real small college town with the college, houses, and a restaurant. That's all.

**Update:** I didn't go to college. Wrote about that [here](https://soffes.blog/four-years).
