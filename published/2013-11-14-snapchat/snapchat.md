# Snapchat

Today Snapchat [turned down](http://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2013/11/13/report-facebook-offered-snapchat-3-billion/3517929/) a $3,000,000,000 offer from Facebook. That is a stupid amount of money. They have less than 30 employees. Wow.

Here's my favorite response:

Here&#39;s a pie chart to explain why: <a href="http://t.co/fX9VUICa5V">pic.twitter.com/fX9VUICa5V</a></p>&mdash; Ray William Johnson (@RayWJ) <a href="https://twitter.com/RayWJ/statuses/400707102491947008">November 13, 2013</a></blockquote>

In all seriousness, I'm sure they had a good reason. On the outside, ==it's hard to imagine a business turning down an offer with more zeros in it than dollars they've ever made.== No one has heard why they turned it down. I'd love to know. Obviously part of it is they think they can get more. Hopefully they last long enough to make that happen.

I don't understand their endgame though. It would be really hard to make ads work well. There's no way people will pay for their service. I think their only hope is to sell. ==100% crazy.==
