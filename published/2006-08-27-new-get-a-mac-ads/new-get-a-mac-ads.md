# New Get A Mac Ads

Apple has just released three new TV ads that are soo funny. They are titled ‘Accident’, ‘Angel/Devil’, and ‘Trust Mac’. The Accident one is about the new MagSafe connector. The PC is hurt because it got yanked off a desk. The Angel/Devil ad is about the PC being jealous of an iPhoto album that the Mac has. The Trust Mac video is about no spyware on Mac OS X. The PC is trying not to be seen and the Mac makes fun of it. Go [watch them](http://web.archive.org/web/20060902082807/http://www.apple.com/getamac/).
