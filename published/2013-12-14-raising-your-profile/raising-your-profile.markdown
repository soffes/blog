Recently, I recorded [a video](http://teamtreehouse.com/library/treehouse-friends/raising-your-profile-sam-soffes) with my friend [Pasan](https://twitter.com/pasanpr) over at [Treehouse](http://teamtreehouse.com). We talked about raising your profile online.

==Personal branding is very important to me. It's something that requires effort. It's not random chance people know (or don't know) who you are.==

Anyway, **[give it a watch](http://teamtreehouse.com/library/treehouse-friends/raising-your-profile-sam-soffes)** if you're interested. It's 35 minutes long and in interview format.
