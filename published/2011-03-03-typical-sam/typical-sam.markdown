# Typical Sam

National Geographic released [a video about the typical human](http://news.yahoo.com/s/yblog_thelookout/20110303/us_yblog_thelookout/the-most-typical-face-on-the-planet). It's really interesting. You should watch it.

I was curious how typical I am. Here's the typical traits and how I line up:

* **Right handed:** ==Yep==
* **Makes less than $12,000 a year:** Nope
* **Owns a cell phone:** ==Yep==
* **Doesn't have a bank account:** Nope
* **Male:** ==Yep==
* **28 years old:** Nope
* **Chinese:** Nope

So I answered ==Yep== to 42% of the traits. I guess that means I'm about the typical amount of not typical. (Ya, read that again. I felt clever writing it.) So, cool. That was fun.
