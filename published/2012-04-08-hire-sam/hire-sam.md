# Hire Sam

You can now [hire me](http://hire.soff.es/). During the next few months, I'll be mainly focused on some [upcoming products](http://nothingmagical.com), but I need to eat so here we are. You can now hire me for up to 10 hours a week for $200/hr. I know that's expensive, but I need to guard my time.

==Bootstrapping is hard.== I only have so much in the bank. It's really painful to watch it dwindle away. This whole process has put the pressure on. ==I love it!== This is amazing motivation. The only reason I'm contracting is to keep my runway going longer so I have more time to get some products ready. Honestly, I could go without contracting, but the extra cushion will be nice.

==I whipped up a little site and posted it at <http://hire.soff.es>==. (The source is [on Github](https://github.com/soffes/hire) by the way.) Head on over and hire me if you're interested. The first 4 weeks are already booked. ==The following weeks are already in talks so be quick.==
