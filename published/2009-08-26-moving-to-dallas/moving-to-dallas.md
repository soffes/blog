# Moving to Dallas

I'm moving to Dallas. For real. I know I've said I'm moving here and there over the past few months, but I already have a place to live and such in Dallas so it's official this time.

## Why

I started working for [Tasteful Works][] a few weeks ago. [Tasteful Works][] develops iPhone, Android, Rails, and Mac apps (I only work on iPhone, Mac, and Rails there). It's good times. I am running all of my freelance through there now, so if you want to hire me, [contact Tasteful Works](mailto:hireus@tastefulworks.com). It's all the same rates as when I was doing it on my own just faster because we have more people.

## So Dallas?

I'm moving to Dallas because that is where all of the [Tasteful Works][] guys are. I'm pretty excited about it, but sad about leaving all of my friends, [my band](http://hollowtheband.com), and [my house](http://www.flickr.com/photos/samsoffes/sets/72157616644807946/).

I am going to have a [sweet loft](http://loftsatlascolinas.com/) in Las Colinas on the lake. I'm really excited about it. It's got high ceilings and exposed duct work. Awesome. I move in on October 1. Crazy.

This new time in my life is really excited and scary. You'd think I'd have moving to a town where I don't know anyone except the people I work with would be easy after doing it once before. I'm optimistic about it, but still a little nervous. Selling or renting my house here in Edmond is going to be stressful.

I'm ready for what's next. Bring it on!
