# Coda 2

Panic just released their Coda 2 teaser site. It's ridiculously impressive.

In the tour video, they are editing a WordPress site and uploading files via FTP. Back when I was doing PHP, Coda was my go to editor. It looks like it's still targeted at that market. On the list of new features is "Improved Ruby." Fingers crossed.

Their fancy CSS editor looks amazing. If that and the iPad preview work with SASS, I'll be very, very happy.

They also announced [Diet Coda](http://panic.com/dietcoda/) today. It's designed for making quick edits on your iPad. This looks amazing.

Their [coming soon page](http://panic.com/coda/comingsoon.html) has a calendar event you can download that reminds your to buy Coda 2 when it comes out. Totally love that.

I can't wait to try all of this new Panic goodness.
