# Setting Up Open Source and Live Coding — Part 1

This is a play-by-play screencast of me moving a component out of SSToolkit into its own library. I cover setting up a good open source component, writing Core Graphics drawing code, a bit of low-level C stuff, and some of my workflow.

You can find the code so far for this on GitHub: [github.com/soffes/SAMGradientView](https://github.com/soffes/SAMGradientView). We’ll be adding a lot more in part 2.

## Here are some things I mentioned

* [SSToolkit](http://sstoolk.it)
* [SAMBadgeView](https://github.com/soffes/SAMBadgeView)
* [Three20](https://github.com/facebook/three20)
* [NimbusKit](http://nimbuskit.info)
* [My blog post on ARC](/automatic-reference-counting)

Also note, this video is to give you a sense of how I work and hopefully teach you stuff along the way. There are a few edits. Mainly to save you time. I cut out about 12 minutes of me wasting time. There wasn’t anything of value you missed out on I promise. I’m just looking out for your time :)

I’d really love some feedback. Leave a comment here or tweet me at [@soffes](https://twitter.com/soffes) on Twitter.
