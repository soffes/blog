# samsoff.es

So I bought a new domain. It was super expensive, but it saves typing 3 more characters. I need to start switching all of my email and such now. Any old links, will still work and redirect.

I also put up a new song called ==Something I Wish I Had== on the [podcast feed](http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewPodcast?id=292395055). Check it out if you get a minute.
