# Five instead of Four

So someone just called me at 1:30am and woke me up. They were trying to order pizza from Pizza Shuttle in Norman, OK about 40 minutes from my apartment.

I get this all of the time. Whenever I get a call from a 405 number that I don't know I just assume they are trying to order pizza. I usually tell people you meant to dial 354-4440 instead of 365-4440 (my number). It's pretty annoying to say the least.

I've tried to mess with people and take orders before, but it never really works out. One time I tried it the girl said the driver locked her out of her house and she needed the phone number of his girlfriend or something like that. I just hung up.
