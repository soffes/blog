# Tin Can

Recently Seesaw open sourced [Tin Can](https://github.com/seesawco/tincan). I worked on this awhile ago when I was at Seesaw. We used it to provide authentication with phone numbers via SMS and verification links.

It's a simple Rack app you can mount in your own app. It provides a simple API for sending a verification SMS and then verifying it.

To get started:

``` sh
$ gem install tincan
```

For more information, [check it out on GitHub](https://github.com/seesawco/tincan).
