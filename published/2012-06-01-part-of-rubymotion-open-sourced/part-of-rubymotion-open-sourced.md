# Part of RubyMotion Open Sourced

This is really amazing to hear.

> After much thought and deliberation, we decided to open parts of RubyMotion. We believe that this will make it even easier for the community to contribute to and extend the RubyMotion platform, leading to a better RubyMotion for everyone.
>
> Today, we are opening the “lib” directory of RubyMotion, which contains the build system, project Rakefile, the configuration object and also the project vendoring system. Check out the [HipByte/RubyMotion](https://github.com/HipByte/RubyMotion) repository.

I can't wait to see the community start improving this already growing platform.
