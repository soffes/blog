# SuperConf 2013

The wonder folks at [SuperConf](http://superconf.co) asked me to come to warm Miami and give a talk. I decided to talk about ==Building Realtime Applications==.

<script async class="speakerdeck-embed" data-id="9f6990305edd01307e0412313b031ac2" data-ratio="1.77777777777778" src="//speakerdeck.com/assets/embed.js"></script>

Here are the links for everything I talked about:

* [Seesaw](https://seesaw.co) — where I work
* [Cheddar](https://cheddarapp.com) — a to do app I made
* [Service-oriented Applications](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service-oriented_architecture) — a great way to build applications
* [Totter](https://github.com/seesawco/totter) — Seesaw API Ruby Gem
* [OAuth 2.0](http://oauth.net/2) — great authentication
* [HTML5](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5) — the future
* [WebSockets](http://websocket.org) — realtime communication between clients and servers
* [Pusher](http://pusher.com) — awesome hosted WebSockets
* [Bully](https://github.com/soffes/bully) — Objective-C Pusher client
* [Go make stuff](http://soff.es/how-to-learn)

I started a tradition of buying a new [H&FJ](http://typography.com) font whenever I give a talk. I bought [Whitney](http://www.typography.com/fonts/font_overview.php?productLineID=100026&path=head) first. Then [Gotham](http://www.typography.com/fonts/font_overview.php?productLineID=100008&path=head). I'm finally getting back to buying new fonts after using Gotham for a really long time. Such a great font. Anyway, I bought [Landmark](http://www.typography.com/fonts/font_overview.php?productLineID=100044&path=head) and [Verlag](http://www.typography.com/fonts/font_overview.php?productLineID=100009&path=head) to use in this talk. I took a ton of inspiration from the Landmark sample images when I was making my slides.

Hopefully you learned something or at least enjoyed seeing me have disproportional amount of fun with my new fonts. You should say hi [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/soffes) sometime.
