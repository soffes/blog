# I Hate Apple

Ha ha, not really. I had you fooled for a second, didn’t I. I have gone through the worst experience with my 12-inch PowerBook G4. The hard drive died 369 days after I bought it. Apple’s policy is that you have to buy the extended warrany (AppleCare) within your first year of owning the machine. That extra 4 days has caused me the worst headache ever. I was very frustrated at Apple, but It’s all good now. They fixed my PowerBook for free (a $349 value).

I think I’m going to buy a [LaCie 300gb Extreme Triple Interface](http://www.smalldog.com/product/36047). Though about the [LaCie Bigger Disk Extreme 2TB](http://www.smalldog.com/product/36058), but I figured that was a little excessive and pricey at $1,655. I’m just hlad they are fixing my computer for free.
