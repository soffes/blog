# Hello Internet: Selling My Stuff

So, I'm selling all of my stuff.

I'm a big fan of minimalism. Every so often I get the urge to drastically simplify my life. This time around I [have a good reason](http://soff.es/here-we-go-again). It's exciting. I don't need really anything I have. It's definitely nice to have nice stuff, but I don't need it. I'm excited to simplify.

There's a list of stuff I'm selling [on Yardsale](https://www.getyardsale.com/users/4041). If you're in San Francisco and want to buy something, hit me up on Yardsale. If you're not in San Francisco and want to buy something, hit me up [via email](mailto:sam@soff.es).
