# Notebooks

I've found whenever I get stuck on something hard, notebooks help. There is something about writing stuff down in a notebook that really helps me think.

Whiteboards are fun and all, but I think they are a little more distracting than useful when you're working by yourself. All of the setup required to just put your thoughts down is a bit much most of the time. Once you're done at the whiteboard, then you have to figure out a way to save your thoughts so you can reference them later. Don't get me wrong, great when brainstorming in a group, but I've found they are way less productive than a notebook when working a lone.

My favorite notebook is the [Behance Dot Grid Book](http://www.creativesoutfitter.com/Products/Dot-Grid-Book/9) (only $14). It's super high quality. I'm a big fan. (I also really like [Moleskin](http://www.amazon.com/Moleskine-Square-Notebook-Pocket/dp/888370102X/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1313986191&sr=8-1) too.) The [Pilot G2 Pen](http://www.amazon.com/Pilot-Retractable-Roller-Barrel-12-Count/dp/B00006JNJ8) is my all time favorite pen. I've used it exclusively (when possible) since 2007.

It's really great to flip through past notebooks and see cool things I designed or problems I struggled through that were once really hard that are now easy. Most of my doodles are abstract drawings, UI wireframes, or lists of elements of a problem. I've found I get to a solution fastest by simply listing all of the parts of the problem. It also really helps to simply list (in sentences even) what I will do to solve it.

For some reason, this is so much more effective to me than opening [TextMate](http://macromates.com) and doing the same thing. Anyway, I recommend trying this. It has helped me countless times over the years.
