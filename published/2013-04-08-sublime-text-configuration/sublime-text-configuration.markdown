# Sublime Text 2 Configuration

For a long time, I've been symlinking my [Sublime Text](http://sublimetext.com) configuration from Dropbox to where it wants it. Last night, I wiped my computer and remembered how handy this is.

Someone on Twitter suggested that I put it in git instead. Definitely a much better idea. Here's [my Sublime Text configuration](https://github.com/soffes/sublime). It just adds packages I've installed that aren't the default, my theme, and of course all of my preferences.

Hopefully you find it useful.
