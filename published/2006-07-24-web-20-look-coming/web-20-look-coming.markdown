title: Web 2.0 Look Coming
categories: meta web

I started working on a new look for [samsoffes.com](http://samsoffes.com) because I was bored one day. I figured, why not make it Web 2.0ish because that’s what seems to be popular and what people like. So far, I’m really liking the new look. Summer has been crazy, so who knows how long it will take me. At least I’ve started…

With the new look, comes a new style. I’ll be switching from WordPress (my blogging engine) to my own CMS (content management system). Why? Because I can. That will take a little while to get going, but once I do, rock on.
