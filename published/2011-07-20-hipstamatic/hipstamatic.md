# Hipstamatic

Lately I've been working with [Hipstamatic](http://heysynthetic.com) on a new really exciting product. I can't really say any more than that, but it's going to be awesome.

I've been having a lot of fun learning about image processing. Who knew writing your own [gaussian blur](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaussian_blur) was really hard?

It's kind of a perfect setup for me right now. Their office is 2 blocks from my apartment and everyone is super awesome to work with. It's also great being a contractor. All of the freedoms that come with that are really great.

Hopefully, I'll be able to post a little of what I've been working on in a few months.
