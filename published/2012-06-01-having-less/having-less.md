# Having Less

When I left my last job a few months ago, I decided to simplify. Partly to save money to pay for my expenses and partly to just have less stuff.

Currently, the only furniture in my apartment is my desk, bed, and table. I'll also most likely be selling my table when I move out of my current apartment. Having almost nothing is fantastic. No TV to distract. No couch to lounge on. Focused.

I spend most of my day working at my desk or outside riding my bike. It's been really great for keeping me focused on [Cheddar](https://cheddarapp.com).

I realize that this is extreme and probably isn't something most people want to do. That said, if you have the option, I recommend trying it.
