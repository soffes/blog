# New Bravia Video

Maybe you remember my post about the [Bravia Videos](http://web.archive.org/web/20060822124043/http://www.bravia-advert.com/balls/). Something is up on the Bravia web site though. It looks like they are planing a new commercial only this time they are using paint. I canâ€™t wait. It looks like it will be even more amazing than before.
