# I Like Gowalla

[Gowalla][] is a cool newish iPhone game from [Alamofire][] (I love those guys). Here's the official blurb:

> [Gowalla][] is about going new places, doing remarkable things and meeting great people along the way.

I really enjoy using it. I took a small vacation with [my mother](http://www.facebook.com/dsoffes) to Denver, CO this week. We were hanging out in Estes Park wondering where to eat. I popped open [Gowalla][] and found a [nice little place](http://gowalla.com/spots/17941) to eat dinner. After we ate, we walked around town and got all of the [other spots](http://twitpic.com/hdtso) in Estes Park (I even [created one](http://gowalla.com/spots/24508)).

Now I'm hooked. I have the urge to hit ever spot around me to get the stamp on [my Gowalla password](http://gowalla.com/samsoffes). I'm a sucker for points and achievements. Not to mention there's the whole items part, which is a lot of fun.

Go give [Gowalla][] a try and [friend me up](http://gowalla.com/samsoffes). It's fun. I promise.
