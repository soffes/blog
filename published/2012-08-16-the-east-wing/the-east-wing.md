# The East Wing

[Tim Smith](http://timothybsmith.com) was gracious enough to have me on [The East Wing](http://theeastwing.net/episodes/22-sam). We talked about [App.net silliness](http://samsoff.es/posts/app-net-is-dreaming-small), [Cheddar](http://cheddarapp.com), and bunch of other stuff. It was a really good time.

[Give it a listen](http://theeastwing.net/episodes/22-sam).
