# Xbox 360 and HD TV

Christmas is coming a little early for me this year. I just purchased an Insignia 26-inch LCD HDTV. It was only $379 at Best Buy. It’s a pretty good TV. It was really cheap so I didn’t expect it to be fantastic, but so far, it’s pretty nice. I only bought it because it was cheap. Since I have this nice new HDTV, what am I going to do with it? I guess I’ll have to buy an Xbox 360. So I did.

It’s pretty nice too. I really like the 360. I was going to buy a Wii, but I changed my mind. I figured that, at the end of the day, I’d rather sit on my couch and play Halo 3 or something instead of run around and play tennis or something physical. Doesn’t that defeat the purpose of video games. I thought the whole point was to be lazy. The Wii is awesome if you have a group of people. If it’s just me in my apartment, I’d rather play the 360.
