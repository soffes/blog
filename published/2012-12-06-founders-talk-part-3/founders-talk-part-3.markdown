[Adam Stacoviak](https://twitter.com/adamstac) was kind enough to have me on [Founders Talk](http://5by5.tv/founderstalk/40) for a third time! I'm super honored that he wanted to do a part 3.

From Adam:

> Core take away? **Embrace risk.** *Stay focused.*

*I think that's the heart of what I have to say. Focus and [doing](http://soff.es/how-to-learn) are key.*

Here is [the article I mentioned about the Hipstamatic story](http://www.fastcompany.com/3002103/intimate-portrait-innovation-risk-and-failure-through-hipstamatics-lens). (It was Fast Company not Inc. Oops.)

[Give it a listen](http://5by5.tv/founderstalk/40). Also be sure to listen to [part 1](http://5by5.tv/founderstalk/38) and [part 2](http://5by5.tv/founderstalk/39) first if you haven't heard them.

**Update:** Check out [part 4](http://soff.es/founders-talk-part-4).
