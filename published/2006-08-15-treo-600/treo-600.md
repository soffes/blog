# Treo 600

A while ago someone gave me an AT&T Treo 600. Treo’s run from $300 - $400 so I was really pumped to get one for free, but it was AT&T and I have Cingular. So I just left it sitting there and figured I couldn’t do anything about except play palm games on it.

Two days ago I thought, how hard could it be? I bought a cable for it on eBay for $9.99 and today I sat down to try and unlock it to work with Cingular. After 3 hours and lots of frustration and flashing the firmware 4 or 5 times, it worked! I thought that I would never get it, but it popped up and was like you have voicemail. I looked at the top and it said Cingular! When you turn it on it still says AT&T, but it works!

If you need a Treo 600 unlocked, e-mail me and I’ll help you out. It’s not that hard once you figure out what you have to do and get the right software (which is really, really, really hard to find). I’m still not sure if the software I used is illegal or not. It didn’t say it was but it was really hard to find.
