# Custom Mechanical Keyboard

I ordered a [mechanical keyboard](http://www.wasdkeyboards.com/index.php/products/mechanical-keyboard/wasd-v2-87-key-custom-mechanical-keyboard.html) from [WASD Keyboards](http://www.wasdkeyboards.com) awhile back. I got Cherry MX Brown switches. The still have a satisfying click but aren’t insanely loud like greens or blues. After having it for awhile, I decided to get dampers for it to make it even quieter. This made it feel too squishy and I removed them.

A few months in, I decided to design new keycaps. It’s fairly cheap to order a new set, so you can change your mind often if you’re into that. Here’s my latest iteration:

I set the text in [SF Compact](https://developer.apple.com/fonts) like the new MacBook Pros. I decided not have modifiers anywhere. To me, it feels super clean this way. It only took a few days to get used to what symbols go with each number. No regrets on that. I thought it was neat to use the Unicode symbols for all of the modifiers.

Designing the keycaps only took a few hours of arguing with myself in Illustrator. I tweaked a few of the symbols slightly. Nothing too crazy. They have [free templates](https://support.wasdkeyboards.com/hc/en-us/articles/115007847008-Download-Template-Files) you can download.

If you order one from WASD, you’re welcome to use my design. **[Download the Illustrator file](https://soffes.s3.amazonaws.com/SoffesKeyboard.ai.zip).** I highly recommend ordering their [wrist rest](http://www.wasdkeyboards.com/index.php/products/keyboard-accessories/14-wrist-pad.html). I also got their [fancy USB cable](http://www.wasdkeyboards.com/index.php/products/keyboard-accessories/custom-sleeved-micro-usb-cable.html) (black on black). I'm a sucker for good cables.

Let me know if you design one!
