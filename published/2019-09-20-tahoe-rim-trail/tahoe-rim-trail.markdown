# Tahoe Rim Trail

I took three weeks off to hike the [Tahoe Rim Trail](https://tahoerimtrail.org). It’s a 165 mile trail around Lake Tahoe. Here’s [a map](https://trta.maps.arcgis.com/apps/View/index.html?appid=ef4b7fb55a9a43f988a3cff59a3510e7).

I was really excited about my first [thru-hike](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thru-hiking). I spent a ton of time working on [my gear list](https://lighterpack.com/r/y1k36y), doing research, and planning the details of my trip.

The trip didn’t go as planned though. After only 40 miles, I decided to head home. It started snowing really hard on the 4th day, and I wasn’t really prepared for snow or very cold temperatures.

On the last day I was hiking, my down jacket got wet and I was cold while I was moving. (Down doesn’t keep you warm when it’s wet.) I figured if I was cold while moving, I’d be extremely cold at night. The night before I wore all of the clothes I had (including my jacket) in my sleeping bag and was still really cold. It seemed unsafe to continue.

I shot a little vlog on my phone each day.

The trail was really beautiful. I definitely hope to do all of it next year.
