# New Music: To Wait A Lifetime

So I've been working really hard lately on stuff with my band, [Hollow](http://myspace.com/hollowrock). (I totally hate MySpace by the way. We're in the process of redoing our site.)

Anyway, here is some of our newer stuff that we've been working on. We wrote this intro as something to open our shows with. The band starts playing when everything drops out and it's just piano. It sounds amazing. Hopefully the full recording will be done in a few weeks.

Check it out on [my music page](http://samsoff.es/music) or on [my SoundCloud profile](http://soundcloud.com/soffes/to-wait-a-lifetime-intro). It also threw it in my [podcast feed](http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewPodcast?id=292395055), you can check it out there too. Enjoy.
