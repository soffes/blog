# Valio Con 2013

I had the privilege of being on the App Panel at [Valio Con 2013](http://valiocon.com/2013) back in June. My good friend (and Roon co-creator) [Drew Wilson](https://twitter.com/drewwilson) puts on Valio Con every year.

Here's the video from the panel:

The whole event was a really good time. Check out the rest of the [2013 video](http://valiocon.com/2013) while you're at it. I definitely recommend going to [Valio Con](http://valiocon.com) in 2014 and beyond.
