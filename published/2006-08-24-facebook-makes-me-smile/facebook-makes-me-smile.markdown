# Facebook Makes Me Smile

The new Notes feature in Facebook is awesome. Not only can you tag stuff and do all of the stuff you can do with pictures like comment, etc. you can import RSS feeds from a blog! I just typed in samsoffes.com and it was like ‘click here to save’ or something so I did because I didn’t want to read the stuff around it… and there was my blog inside my Facebook notes page. It made me happy. They check for RSS (actually they use my ATOM feed and not my RSS one, but I like saying RSS better and ATOM is basically the same thing) feeds and then import items separately and people can comment on my posts right from Facebook! There is also a new [developers area](http://web.archive.org/web/20060902082807/http://developers.facebook.com/) on Facebook that I can’t wait to play with.
