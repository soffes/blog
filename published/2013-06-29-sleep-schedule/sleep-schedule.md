# Sleep Schedule

I'm really bad at sleep. There are so many more things I'd rather be doing. There was the one Bond villain that only had to sleep for 15 minutes a day or something. I want that.

I generally go to bed around 2am or 3am. Since I work from home, I wake up around 8:30 and starting in bed right away. I spend an enormous amount of time working in bed instead of at my desk. On most days, I don't get out of bed until 11 or 12. It's pretty great.

After my Seesaw work is doing around 6:30ish, I hang out with family and such. Around 10 or 11 I'll start working on whatever side project I feel like that evening. Lately, it's been [Roon](http://roon.io).

I know I can't keep this up forever. Occasionally, I'll just go to bed at 11 to catch up on sleep. I know this is bad and all, but I get so motivated at night to work on stuff, I just get my laptop out and start hacking away.

Once I move back to San Francisco and get married, I'm sure I'll switch to a more normal schedule. ==In my free time, there is nothing I'd rather do than spend time with family and make stuff, so that's what I do.==

What's important to you? Spend your time on that.
