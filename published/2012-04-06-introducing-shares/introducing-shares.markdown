# Introducing Shares

<a href="http://useshares.com" class="image-left"><img src="http://assets.samsoff.es/images/shares-icon.png" alt="Shares" width="256" height="256" /></a> Really excited to finally be able to introduce [Shares](http://useshares.com). I started working on this app in November. It's come a really long way since then.

### The Pitch

Recently, I bought some Apple stock. (Which, by the way, has been a fantastic investment.) I found myself looking at the price in the stocks dashboard widget then using [Alfred](http://www.alfredapp.com/)'s calculator to do the math to see my change. This got cumbersome quick.

==I just wanted an app to see my overall gain or loss at a glance==, so I made one.

### The Process

The frist version was done in a Saturday. I drew 100% of the UI in code. I was super proud that there were no images in the app. Next, I hired [Kris Mendoza](http://dribbble.com/mendkr) to design a sweet icon for the app. He did a really fantastic job if I do say so myself.

A few weeks later, I had lunch with the fabulous [Josh Brewer](http://jbrewer.me). Shares came up and I showed it to him. He has some ideas to take my silly design and make it super awesome, so we started working together.

Off and on for 5 months we worked on Shares when we had time. ==We are really proud of the end result.==

### That's It

I hope you [give Shares a try](http://useshares.com). I'd love to hear what you think. [Tweet](http://twitter.com/samsoffes) or [email](mailto:sam@nothingmagical.com) me what you think.

This isn't my big idea that I [quit my job](http://soff.es/here-we-go-again) to work on. Shares is just a little side project. If you're curious about my main project, head over to [Nothing Magical](http://nothingmagical.com). All of that is coming soonish though.
