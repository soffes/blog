# WWDC 2010 Predictions

I arrived in San Francisco a couple of hours ago. This week is going to be awesome. I am really looking forward to [WWDC 2010](http://developer.apple.com/wwdc)!

I've been telling a few people what I think Jobs is going to announce tomorrow at the keynote. I figured it would be good to post it so I can brag about how right I was. (Just joking. I'm not really that arrogant.)

## iPhone

==There will be a new iPhone.== All of the crazy rumors, phones left in bars, and cops raiding apartments aside, historically Apple has always announced a new one every year since it was released at WWDC.

I think ==it will have a front-facing camera==. This has been the rumor since before the 3G was released. The prototype found in the bar makes it more convincing this year. Also a [certain beta mobile OS](http://www.apple.com/iphone/preview-iphone-os/) has a ton of new video stuff in it.

I think ==it will have 4G== to keep up with everyone else. I bet they will also ==increase storage space== like they always do.

## iPad

They will just ==brag about their sales== and talk about OS4 stuff. ==I doubt we will see new hardware==, as much as some people want one with a camera.

Personally, I don't see myself taking pictures with it. That said, as a developer, I would like for it to have a camera so universal apps can be more universal. I know Jobs wants the iPad (well really the iPhone OS) to replace the Mac eventually, which think is the right move and totally how it will play out. My Mac has a camera and I would be less likely to take pictures on that than an iPad, so ==maybe one day it will have a camera, but not tomorrow==.

## iTunes & Lala

Since Apple bought [Lala.com](http://lala.com) a couple of months ago, a lot of people have been looking forward to iTunes having some sort of cloud or subscription model. I think ==they will announce some sort of iTunes cloud service tomorrow==. I bet it will be cheaper than something like [Rhapsody](http://www.rhapsody.com) and you know it will be more awesome than everything else out there because Apple designed it.

## AppleTV

A lot of people have been talking about a new AppleTV that is the size of an iPhone and stores all of it's data in the cloud or on a Time Capsule. ==I can see them releasing a new one tomorrow==, but I haven't done much research on this rumor so don't hold me to it.

## Mac

I bet they will just brag about their numbers and refresh specs. This year the focus is on the iPhone and iPad.

## Conclusions

I know a lot of Mac developers were really sad about them cutting the Mac Apple Design Awards, but it doesn't bother me too much. The future is mobile and the iPhone OS. iPhone OS 4 is going to be game changing. ==The Android competition is good.== It is really pushing Apple forward.

I think Steve has a lot of stuff up his sleeves that we don't already know. I know he must have been super pissed about that idiot "leaving his phone in a bar," but he has never had just one thing to show off at WWDC. ==I can't wait to get blown away== (and be in the same room with Jobs).
