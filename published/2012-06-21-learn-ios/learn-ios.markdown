# Learn iOS

Lots of people ask where to begin learning iOS. [This book](http://www.amazon.com/iOS-Programming-Ranch-Edition-Guides/dp/0321821521/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1340324608&sr=1-1&keywords=iPhone+Programming) is hands down the best place to get started. I learned Objective-C from [Mac version](http://www.amazon.com/Cocoa-Programming-Mac-4th-Edition/dp/0321774086/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1340324687&sr=1-1&keywords=Cocoa+Programming) of this book.

It's fantastic. [Aaron](http://www.bignerdranch.com/management) does an amazing job explaining how everything works. ==You should order this book and get started.== It's easier than you think.
