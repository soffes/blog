# Testing Retina Graphics with ResolutionTab

There is a great app called [ResolutionTab](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/resolutiontab/id540141595?mt=12) on the Mac App Store that lets you toggle Retina graphics. Makes it great for testing if you don't have access to one of the new amazing Retina MacBook Pros. Highly recommend.
