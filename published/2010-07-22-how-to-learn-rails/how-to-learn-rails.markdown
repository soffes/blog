# How To Learn Rails

A lot of people ask me how to learn [Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org). I usually forward this email I wrote awhile back to a friend. I figured it would probably be better to post it on my blog so more people can benefit from it.

Here's the email:

> Hey man,
>
> Rails is awesome. If you're not familiar with Ruby, I'd recommend getting acquainted with it first. I spend 2 hours reading [a PDF online](http://www.humblelittlerubybook.com/book/hlrb.pdf) and then jumped in. The more you understand Ruby, the less magical Rails seems. [The Ruby Programming Language](http://www.amazon.com/Ruby-Programming-Language-David-Flanagan/dp/0596516177) is a great book. Matz (the creator of Ruby) is one of the authors. A lot of it is like "this is they way it is because when I designed it I though this". I liked it a lot.
>
> The [Poignant Guide](http://mislav.uniqpath.com/poignant-guide/) is another really popular way to learn Ruby. There's a bit of history to it, but nevermind that for now.
>
> Once you feel semi comfortable with Ruby (i.e. you can make a class that has methods, inheritance, control structures, etc), watch [this 15 minute video](http://media.rubyonrails.org/video/rails_blog_2.mov). It will blow your mind. My next step was going back through it and trying to build it myself. This was really hard at first cause I had no idea what I was doing and didn't understand the syntax yet. Don't worry.
>
> Try to write something simple in Rails. Maybe a blog or to do manager, etc. I learn by doing. This was the best for me. I've rewritten my blog at least 20 times. (By the way, it's open source [on GitHub](http://github.com/samsoffes/samsoff.es).)
>
> The best resource I've found is [Railscasts.com](http://railscasts.com/). They are really well done. Pretty much anything you could want to do, he has already covered. After I got several under my belt, I sorta "got it" and started really understanding what I was writing. #carlhuda on freenode (IRC channel) was also super helpful. [@wycats](http://twitter.com/wycats) (he's on the core team of Rails and jQuery) is in there and he's really great about helping new comers and teaching you stuff.
>
> [Ruby5](http://ruby5.envylabs.com/) is also really great. It's a biweekly 5 minute podcast about news in the Ruby and Rails community. I've found lots of great stuff there.
>
> Let me know if you need any help or have questions. I'd be happy to help.
>
> Sam

### More Stuff

I have several open source projects on my [GitHub profile](http://github.com/soffes). [My blog](http://soff.es/source) and [Markdownr.com](http://markdownr.com) are two fairly straight forward Rails 3 projects.

I highly recommend learning [Git](http://git-scm.org). The [Git documentation page](http://git-scm.com/documentation) will help a lot if you're trying to learn.
