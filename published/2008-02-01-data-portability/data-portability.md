# Data Portability

[DataPortability.org](http://web.archive.org/web/20080221182117/http://dataportability.org/) is a project that aims to connect all of the networks that you are a part of into one system to make all of you data easy to manage. I don’t know how this works yet, but it seems really cool. I’m all for open standards and sharing of data. Check out their website. I want to get involved. Hopefully we’ll see some of this implemented at LifeChurch.tv.
