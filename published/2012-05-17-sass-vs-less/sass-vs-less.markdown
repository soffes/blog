# SASS vs LESS

Chris Coyier from [CSS Tricks](http://css-tricks.com/sass-vs-less/) compares LESS to SASS in the most fair  post I've seen. His conclusion:

> SASS is better on a whole bunch of different fronts, but if you are already happy in LESS, that's cool, at least you are doing yourself a favor by preprocessing.

Most arguments I've read are just "I like SASS better." His is very technical comparison of the two. It's a really interesting read.
