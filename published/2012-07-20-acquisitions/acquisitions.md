# Acquisitions

I'm really bummed today. [Acrylic Apps](http://acrylicapps.com/) got acquired by Facebook. [Sparrow](http://sprw.me/) got acquired by Google.

This is what I want to know: ==What is Facebook doing with all of these acquisitions?== I can tell you. **Nothing.** They haven't shipped anything that works well or looks great in awhile. Their camera iOS app wasn't bad, but from the talent they've acquired, it should be embarrassing.

I mean, Facebook is the worst iOS app on my phone. How many engineers and designers does it take to make a great app in a year? I think it's a really small team and a few months. I think part of the reason nothing is happening is ==there are too many cooks in the kitchen==.

[Sofa](http://www.madebysofa.com/) is one of my favorite design companies. They put out amazing products and did amazing work. Since joining Facebook in 2011, I haven't seen anything come out even remotely that quality. The Gowalla team (by the way, [gowalla.com](http://gowalla.com) doesn't go anywhere. sadface) made great stuff. All of it is way better than the current Facebook stuff.

==Don't even get me started on Google.== Google doesn't have anything that looks really good. They've hired tons of great people, but overall, all of the Google products lack excellence (especially in design).

I'm just really disappointed. ==I wish things at these tech giants would drastically improve as their talent pool grew. We've seen over and over, and this is not the case.== It makes me sad.
