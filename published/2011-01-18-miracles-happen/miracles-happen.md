# Miracles Happen

So I know we all joked that Duke Nukem Forever and Tweetie 2 would never come out.

It's pretty nuts that you can [download Tweetie 2](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/twitter/id409789998?mt=12) (now called Twitter for Mac) and [pre-order Duke Nukem Forever](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002I0HAC6?ie=UTF8&tag=samsoffescom-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B002I0HAC6). I almost don't believe it myself.
