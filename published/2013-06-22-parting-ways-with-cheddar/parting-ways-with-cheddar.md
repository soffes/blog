# Parting Ways With Cheddar

I made this thing called [Cheddar](https://cheddarapp.com) last year. I'm pretty proud of it. I wrote why I stopped working on it [here](/changes). I talked about this whole process at length in Founders Talk [episode 38](http://5by5.tv/founderstalk/38), [episode 39](http://5by5.tv/founderstalk/39), and little in [episode 40](http://5by5.tv/founderstalk/40). (Episode 41 isn't about me. Could have sworn I took over that show.)

Anyway, I posted that I was selling Cheddar a few months back. This has been a very interesting process. I learned a lot and met some really cool people. My biggest take away is most people just wanted to find out a lot because they were curious and were just wasting my time.

Today, the money from the Cheddar sale cleared in my back account. ==It's official. I don't own Cheddar any more.== My good friend [Josh Long](https://twitter.com/joshlong) owns it now. He has some big plans for it. He'll be posting about it soon. I'll [tweet](https://twitter.com/soffes) it out when he does.

This is almost hard to write. I have spent so much time on this thing. Cheddar was all I did for about 5 months. I learned so much working on this. (Definitely listen to those Founders Talk episodes if you're curious. You'll be sick of hearing me and [Adam](https://twitter.com/adamstac) talk by the end of it.)

I'm really glad Josh is taking it over though. It is good hands. ==I think Cheddar users are in for some good surprises. There will be people working on it again!== He's getting a team together to really make Cheddar great. Yay for new features and fixes!

Here's a few stats as of right now.

Thing             | Count
------------------|--------
Users             | 45,725
Lists             | 94,605
Tasks             | 884,462
Third-party Apps  | 1,090
Lines of Code     | 15,907

I wrote (almost) all of that [code](https://github.com/soffes), [designed](https://dribbble.com/soffes) everything (except the logo and icon), responded (or sometimes ignored) all of the support, etc. All of it. There is an iPhone/iPad app, Mac app, web App, open API, and open source Objective-C library. ==That's a lot of stuff for one person. It was exhausting.==

## Onward

I'm so glad I can focus on everything else I have going on. Lately, [Roon](http://roon.io) has been taking most of my free time. I really enjoy hacking on something new with another person. [Drew](http://drew.roon.io) is a ton of fun to work with.

I have a ton of other stuff I've been wanting to work on for awhile that I'll finally have time for. Overall, I'm really happy. I 'll definitely miss it a little though. ==This is definitely best for the Cheddar users too.== The users and the product will finally get the attention they deserve. I'm really happy about that.
