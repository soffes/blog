# 2022

This year was a unique year. I started the year without a job or a place to live. My house in San Francisco just sold, so I had house money in my checking account. Now what?

Here's a video I recorded when I moved out.

## Tulum

Some friends were going to Tulum, Mexico and asked if I wanted to tag along. Booked my tickets on my phone and slept on the couch in their Airbnb.

Two of the four others were divers and wanted to try diving in [cenotes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cenote). I said I'd never done it and wasn't that excited about it, but since I love diving, let's do it.

It was incredible.

A few minutes into the dive, I remember saying to myself "This is incredible. I need to get cave certified." When we surfaced, my friend Chad exclaimed, "This is the coolest thing I've ever done!" Totally agree.

We saw super old Mayan pottery, some fossils, and a [halocline](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halocline). Absolutely incredible.

## Picking Vanlife

After I got back from Mexico in mid-January, I was sitting in an Airbnb outside of Santa Cruz, CA trying to figure out what I'm doing with my life. The rough plan was to travel full time, but everything I thought of sounded boring or lonely.

My good friend, Oren, suggested roadtripping to Baja. That sounded like fun. Something to do at least.

At the time, I had an electric car so I knew getting to Cabo would be really difficult or impossible. I was considering getting a 4Runner or a truck or something with a rooftop tent. A friend (probably Oren) suggested building a van instead.

In the summer of 2020, I build a small camper van for my mom and most of 2020â€“2021 remodeling my house, so I felt like I sorta knew what this would entail. I decided to go for it. Mainly as something to do. I still wasn't that excited about traveling by myself, but building a van sounded fun.

I hadn't really watched much vanlife content, but I was aware people did it, and it sounded fun.

I remember Oren saying something like, "you won't know it's lonely until you try it." So alright, let's get a van.

## Getting the Van

In my Airbnb in Santa Cruz, I started searching for vans. From some quick research, it seemed like most people had Sprinters and there were lots of aftermarket things for them, so I decided to get a Sprinter. All of the dealers I called said they had a waitlist of hundreds and didn't even want my name. Hah. Alright.

On craigslist, I started looking in cities I could get to. I found one that used to be a cupcake concession van in Indianapolis. Seemed good. It was an auction, so I bid on it. Woke up the next morning and had an email that I won! I only had 4 days to drive 2,300 miles. Went to my storage unit, picked up all of my camping & scuba gear, and then hit the road.

2,300 miles is a lot of miles in an EV. It was fine though.

When I showed up, the van was definitely pink.

I was so pumped for it.

The next day when I got to look at it more closely, I realized it was not in great shape like the listing said. Lots of rust and other issues.

So, I sold that van and bought a different one in Boston the next week.

That van would become my home.

I named that van Curiosity, after the spacecraft. Seemed fitting since it was a rover and all. (I named the pink one Cupcake. RIP.)

Curiosity is a 2019 Sprinter 1500 144WB with a high roof. It's gasoline and gets ~16mpg.

## Building the Van

I purchased my van (When I say my van from here on out, I mean Curiosity.) on February 1st.

When you don't live somewhere, the most difficult part of building a van is having somewhere to build it. I originally started at my aunt's house, but turns out I'm super allergic to one of her cats. (The other cat was fine. So weird.)

A few weeks later, I moved to a rental property a friend from high school had that was empty. Drove up to IKEA and bought furniture for it for like $1,200. I love IKEA.

I figured since I was going to be there for a few months, I might as well be comfortable. Just got a bed, couch, and dining table.

Mid-February through end then of April, I built my van. Basically nonstop. Most days, I'd work at least 12 hours on it. Even on the weekend.

My friend, Nick, was getting married in Portland, OR the first weekend in May and I wanted to be in the van when I went. Nick used to live in a van and was super helpful answering a bunch of questions when I was getting started with my build. I thought it would be cool to finish it by then.

At the beginning of April, that was starting to get stressful. I definitely considered flying and then coming back to work on the van. Then I decided, to just get done what I get done and head out May 1st.

That turned out to be a great decision. Getting on the road and living in the van full time was incredible. I didn't think I'd like it as much as I do. Also helped to focus what things to work on next.

If you want to see more about my build, I have a four part series on YouTube. They're all under 10 minutes.
