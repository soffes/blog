# Starting Heavy Rotation

Several weeks ago, I decided I wanted to ship more things.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Starting next month, I want to ship something once a month until the end of the year. It’s been too long.<br><br>Lots of ideas! :D</p>&mdash; Sam Soffes (@soffes) <a href="https://twitter.com/soffes/status/769607908212535302">August 27, 2016</a></blockquote>

The goal was to ship something by the end of September (since I started this goal so late in August). Near the end of September I had started on several things and hadn’t been too excited about any of them. I decided to just write down all of my thoughts and go from there.

I tweeted that I was going to do it live on [Canvas](https://usecanvas.com):

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Back to working on my thoughts on side projects if you want to watch me type some more <a href="https://t.co/7Jw0xB8LDB">https://t.co/7Jw0xB8LDB</a></p>&mdash; Sam Soffes (@soffes) <a href="https://twitter.com/soffes/status/779813028925677568">September 24, 2016</a></blockquote>

A bunch of people opened the page and were watching live. That was pretty awesome to see. All of these heads down the right side of the page were interested in what I was doing. Fantastic motivation. ==Knowing that people are interested in what I’m building makes it easy to push through the not so fun parts== of building a product. Most of it is fun, but there’s always that last 10% that makes you want to quit.

After some back and forth with lots of folks on Twitter, I decided on one of my ideas. Since it was already so late in September, I figured I’d have to wait until next month to release it.

That night, I stayed up until 7am working on one of my ideas. It wasn’t the one I had picked, but it was one I was excited about. That idea was [Heavy Rotation](https://useheavyrotation.com).


### Heavy Rotation

I used to love Rdio. I found so much amazing music in the heavy rotation section. This was the default screen when you opened up their app. It was just a grid of albums your friends were listening to. Most of the music I listen to today is bands I found through Rdio.

After Rdio shutdown, I switched to iTunes. I spend $400 and bought all of the music I was listening to on Rdio. (I really dislike Spotify’s UI and their library was lacking some of the bands I really like.) Awhile later, I switched to Apple Music and have been really happy with that.

Now that I have a good streaming solution again, I still missed discovering what my friends were listening to.
