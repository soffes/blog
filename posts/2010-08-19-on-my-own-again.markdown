So if you remember, I wrote a blog post [about a year ago](http://samsoff.es/posts/moving-to-dallas) about life and such. I [quit my job](http://samsoff.es/posts/i-dont-have-a-boss-anymore) and then freelanced for a bit. After doing that for a bit and hating it, I started working at [Tasteful Works](http://tastefulworks.com). It's been a good ride here at Tasteful Works, but ==August 31 is my last day==. Still friends with those guys. Quality dudes.

### What I'll Be Doing

I'm already booked for the next 3+ months with a lot of iPad and Rails work. It's for a client or I'd say more. It's a really cool project. After that, I'll be doing looking for some contract projects and work on my own stuff.

I plan to focus more on fun open source projects now that I'm my own. I already have a bunch of stuff started [on my GitHub account](http://github.com/samsoffes), but more on that later. It will also be good to have more time for [music](http://samsoff.es/music) and life in general.

I've already gotten a few job offers. For now, I plan on sticking with working for myself, but who knows how long that will last. This seems to be a bit of a cycle: keep a job for a year-ish, freelance, new job, freelance, etc. I'm hoping to keep working for myself for a lot longer this time.

### What About...

==Double Shot== - No idea. Tasteful Works owns all of that code. Hopefully it will get released eventually. It's some of my best work.

==TWToolkit== - Check out my forks: [SSToolkit](http://github.com/samsoffes/sstoolkit), [SSOAuthKit](http://github.com/samsoffes/ssoauthkit), and [SSZipArchive](http://github.com/samsoffes/ssziparchive). The Tasteful Works versions will remain, although I won't be working on them anymore.

==Countdown Maker== - [Countdown Maker](http://tastefulworks.com/countdown-maker) and [Stage Time](http://tastefulworks.com/stage-time) will remain Tasteful Works products. Kinda hate to see them go, but oh well. Hopefully they will continue to be maintained.
