title: Don't Censor Me
tags: [complaining]

You know what really grinds my gears? People telling me what to tweet. Past employers have occasionally found issues with what I have to say. It's not like what I was saying was untrue either.

Granted, I can see where someone would be coming from on the other side of this issue. My problem is that my Twitter account is mine. Who is the employer to tell me how to use a website? I didn't see anything in my employment agreement about their right to censor my tweets.

The worst is someone on Twitter telling me what to tweet. I'll run my Twitter account and you run yours. This is the silliest thing ever. If you are greatly offended by some string of 140 characters, don't listen. It's the dumbest thing to get all worked up about.

This is the most #firstworldproblems blog post ever. Don't mind my complaining.
