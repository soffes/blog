title: iPhone Update 1.1.1 and Installer.app
tags: [iphone, jailbreak]

I, like many others I waited in line on June 29, 2007 for the Apple iPhone. As you all know, I'm a coder. I like like to tinker with stuff and see how it works. I had apps on my phone long before [Null River](http://web.archive.org/web/20071014203346/http://nullriver.com/) released their [installer.app](http://web.archive.org/web/20071014203346/http://iphone.nullriver.com/). I was using jailbreak, iphoneinterface, and other random tools from the iphone-dev-team.

After hearing [Kevin Rose](http://kevinrose.com/) [speak so highly](http://web.archive.org/web/20071014203346/http://revision3.com/diggnation/2007-09-06extra8) of installer.app, I decided to give it a try. I love installer.app. It makes doing stuff so easy. For someone that isn't that code savvy, it is perfect.

When I saw the [iPhone 1.1.1 update](http://www.appleinsider.com/articles/07/09/27/apple_iphone_update_1_1_1_offers_louder_volume_adds_itunes.html) today, I got scared. After reading [this AppleInsider story](http://www.appleinsider.com/articles/07/09/27/apple_iphone_update_1_1_1_offers_louder_volume_adds_itunes.html), I was even more scared. This is at the top of the EULA of the update:

> If you have modified your iPhone's software, applying this software update may result in your iPhone becoming permanently inoperable…

I thought it would be a good idea to put my iPhone into recovery mode before updating so it wouldn't check my hard drive. That didn't work. It just downloaded the update and gave me an error. It just let me with a black screen. I rebooted it and it automatically went into recovery mode. iTunes then updated it just fine. Hopefully it will work for everyone else and not break their iPhone.
