Part of being an engineer (especially in San Francisco) is getting recruiter emails. Most of the time, they are [awful](http://awfulrecruiters.com).

Recently, I received an email from the CEO of a company that I'm a big fan of. He wanted me to join his company. ==After interviewing and thinking about it a lot, I accepted the offer.== The whole time I kept thinking that I could keep working on [Cheddar](http://cheddarapp.com) on the side and if it took off, I could quit and work on it full time. The more I thought about it, the more I realized that that was more exciting than working at this really cool company.

==After much deliberation, I told them I had changed my mind and was going to continue working on stuff at [Nothing Magical](http://nothingmagical.com)== (my stuff) full time. They were disappointed, but respected the decision. This was a super hard decision, but I think it's the right thing.

Lots of my friends and people I respect enforced that this. ==Working on my own products is the most fulfilling thing I've ever had the privilege to do==. Hopefully Cheddar does great and I can continue to keep doing this. Thank you everyone for your encouragement along the way. I can't tell you enough how much I appreciate it.
