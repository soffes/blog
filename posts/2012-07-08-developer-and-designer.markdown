Just started chaining my bio on social networks to this:

> Developer & Designer at Nothing Magical. Currently working on <http://cheddarapp.com>

I never really considered myself a designer, but I spend a ton of time designing things now. A few people asked me how I learned: ==trial & error==.

As far as design goes, I have no idea what I'm doing. I just try a bunch of stuff until I don't hate it. Some things come more naturally than others. I spent almost no time on [Cheddar for iOS](http://cheddarapp.com/apps) design-wise. The pieces just fell into place. Things like the [Cheddar homepage](http://cheddarapp.com) took forever.

The one thing I have learned about trying to be a designer is ==the process is everything==. The whole experience of trying things and realizing what does and doesn't work **is** designing. It took me awhile to appreciate this part of it.

Go make stuff.
