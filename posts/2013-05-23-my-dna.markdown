Recently, I spit in a plastic tube and mailed it to California. While that sounds like a fun prank, it was to get my DNA tested by [23andMe](http://refer.23andme.com/a/clk/4VL1gj). The first few minutes of [this video](http://refactor.tv/31) show the unboxing/spitting.

23andMe is a really neat company that has been around since 2007. They process your DNA and tell you what it means. It's only $99 to get yours tested.

Here's the highlights from my results.

### Traits

The most fascinating part was the traits. Here are a few of the interesting ones:

Trait                   | Outcome
------------------------|--------------------------------
Alcohol Flush Reaction  | Does Not Flush
Bitter Taste Perception | Unlikely to Taste
Eye Color               | Likely Brown
Hair Curl               | Slightly Curlier Hair
Lactose Intolerance     | Likely Tolerant
Caffeine Consumption    | Slightly Higher Amount Per Day
Height                  | Averaged 0.3–0.7cm taller

It's crazy how all of them were right on. Fascinating.


### Disease Risk

It also shows tons of diseases and your risk for them. Here are a few that are below for me.

Disease                          | Risk
---------------------------------|------
Alzheimer's Disease              | 4.9%
Age-related Macular Degeneration | 1.6%
Rheumatoid Arthritis             | 1.5%
Type 1 Diabetes                  | 0.17%

Of the ones that had increased risk, none of them were too scary thankfully. Before they tell you a few of them, they present a ton of information and you have to click I understand before they tell you the result (Alzheimer's for one). Thankfully, I have a lower risk for all of those.

### Ancestry

I knew my mother's side was British before coming to America in the colonies. Seeing a tad of Native American and African in there makes sense. I knew there was some Cherokee in there, so it was cool to see the results matched that. You can really drill down on this graph. Here's the overview though:

This wasn't as interesting to me as the health/traits stuff, but still pretty cool.

### See My Genome

I posted my genome on GitHub: [github.com/soffes/dna](https://github.com/soffes/dna). You can download it and look through my source code. Pretty fascinating.

Pull requests welcome.
