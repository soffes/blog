Recently, I updated [my hire page](http://hire.samsoff.es) with my new rate: $1000/hr. Lots of people on Twitter have been going on and on about how this is ridiculous or how awesome they think this is.

*If you think it's too high, don't hire me.* Simple as that.

This rate is designed to weed out less serious clients. Serious clients generally have more exciting projects. I'd rather not freelance. I need to focus on [Cheddar](http://cheddarapp.com). I don't mind telling you what I think you should do or giving other advice. That is super enjoyable.

*I'd expect most of my clients will want me to just come and talk to them for a few hours. If anyone hires me to write code for $1000/hr, they are wasting their money.* If you are looking for hired programmers, you should talk to my friends at [Oven Bits](http://ovenbits.com) or [Bixby Apps](http://bixbyapps.com) (be sure and tell them I sent you if you hit them up).

My first client at this new rate wants me to come to their office and pair with their iOS developer for 3 hours. I'm going to help him optimize some code in an area I have lots of expertise. Frankly, I'm really excited about it. I can't say the same for almost any other freelance project I've done.

For programming, I was charging $200/hr, but I'd rather not do any more programming freelance gigs. I spend most of my days programming. I'm not itching to do more.

I know a few other developers have charged this much in the past. *I agree with you that for programming, this is entirely too high.* Anyone that hires them for any sizable amount of time is wasting their money.
