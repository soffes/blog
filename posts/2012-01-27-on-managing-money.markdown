title: On Managing Money

I generally suck at managing money. My usual attitude to paying for anything is "I need this, so here is the money." When people ask me how much things cost, I never know. *This is stupid.*

I've kinda of brainwashed myself into thinking I don't have a choice except to pay for this. Doing pretty well as a software engineer in San Francisco makes this a possibility. I realize how stupid this is.

Anyway, I'm starting to *hopefully* break the habit.

### Progress

Monthly subscriptions seemed like a logical place to start. I had a ton of services I have been paying for and either not using at all or could easily go without. Here's a list of services I canceled or downgraded tonight:

* Netflix - watching less TV now
* Hulu - watching less TV now
* GitHub - not using pay features
* Zipcar - not using any more
* Railscasts - really love, but can go without for now
* Vimeo - not using any more
* Flickr - not using any more
* Dropbox - started using Rdio, so no longer need the extra space for iTunes syncing
* Xbox Live - rarely use and can go without
* Rdio - switched from a family plan
* DNSMadeEasy - switched to a cheaper service

I was pretty proud of the big dent I made in my wasted spending. *That's $930 in savings a year. Not bad.*

### Do It.

This is a great exercise. I just went through my bank statements and identified as many of these subscriptions as possible. The yearly ones are obviously harder to find, but you get the idea. *Anyway, if you suck at managing money, this is a good place to start. Highly recommend.*

**Update 03/04/12:** Signed up for Netflix, Hulu, Github, and Railscasts again. Oh well.
