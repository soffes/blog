I had the amazing privilege of being on [Founders Talk](http://5by5.tv/founderstalk/38) with [Adam Stacoviak](https://twitter.com/adamstac).

We talked a lot about [my life history](http://samsoff.es/posts/four-years) and [things I've learned from Cheddar](http://samsoff.es/posts/cheddar-lessons-so-far). ==I don't think I've ever talked publicly about this much of my life.==

Anyway, if you're curious about where I've come from, [Cheddar](http://cheddarapp.com), or what's next, [give it a listen](http://samsoff.es/posts/cheddar-lessons-so-far).

Adam and I have planned to do a part 2 episode with more stuff regarding recent stuff happening with Cheddar. [Follow me on Twitter](http://twitter.com/samsoffes) for details.

**Update:** Check out [part 2](http://samsoff.es/posts/founders-talk-part-2).
