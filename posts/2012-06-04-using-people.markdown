The number of people that talk to me only when they want something is decently high. This bothers me a lot. If the only time you talk to me is to ask a programming question,  to ask if I know some you can hire me to make something for you, or to ask me to fix your iPhone, it's kind of a slap in the face.

I don't mind doing any of those things for friends. If we haven't talked in 5 years and message me on Facebook with 2 sentences asking me to solve your problem, don't expect a positive reply.
