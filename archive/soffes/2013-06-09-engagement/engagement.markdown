# Engagement Photos

Last week, the amazing [Todd Balsley](http://www.abnyphotography.com) took some photos of Ellen and I. ==We shot some photos in downtown Louisville, Kentucky.== I think they turned out pretty great.

Most of them were shot with his nice Canon gear. For a couple of them, he used my [RX1](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00AES296Q/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B00AES296Q&linkCode=as2&tag=samsof0b-20). Pretty awesome that my little camera can keep up with the sweet high-end stuff.

Anyway, here's a few of my favorites.
