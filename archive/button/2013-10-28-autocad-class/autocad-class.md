# AutoCAD Class

Today I took a class at [TechShop](http://techshop.ws/) on [AutoCAD](http://www.autodesk.com/products/autodesk-autocad/overview). It was a really good time.

The class was only $35 for three hours. Only one other person attended. Super awesome. I learned a lot about 2D and 3D drawing. Really excited to apply this to Button.

The class was mainly on 2D drawing, but toward the end we started working in 3D. The instructor asked if we had any ideas to make. I obviously had a suggestion :)

Hereâ€™s what I drew:

I might take a class on [Inventor](http://www.autodesk.com/products/autodesk-inventor-family/overview) next since you get a free license if you join TechShop.
