# Materials

Today I had a realization about materials. The original goal was to use aluminum. The other student at my [class last night](/autocad-class) mentioned that I might have trouble with signals and aluminum. I hadn’t thought of that!

After talking with the instructor a bit, I landed on plastic. They have machines at TechShop that can do everything I’ll need for plastic and it’s a lot cheaper. ==I really want Button to be affordable, so I’ll probably go with plastic.==

The plan is to just get some friends together and spend a weekend making them all if that’s possible. I have no idea how long it will take to make one or how many orders I’ll get. Either way, excited!

Yay progress.
