# Introducing Button

## The Beginning

This is a story of a project. After years and years of iOS & web development, I’ve grown bored of solving the same problems over and over. You can only hit an API and show results in a table view so many times. I no longer find these problems stimulating or interesting.

==It’s time to learn something new.== Hardware is fascinating. I’ve always wanted to get into it, but it’s hard. There’s so much to learn. This is exciting.

At first, I set out to build a smartwatch. The thought of making an operating system sounds really fun. After researching parts, I realized I was in way over my head.

In the spirit of iteration, I decided to build something simpler: ==**a button**==. I was frustrated with the iPhone app that controls the WiFi lights in my apartment (first-world problems, I know). I thought, what if I could make a button to just toggle my lights? How hard could that be? Then it struck me, ==I should make a button that can perform an HTTP request.== That’s what I’m making.


## No Nonsense

I want to make a button that simply performs a request and that’s it. You could make it do anything.

Smack it on your way out of the office to text a loved one you’re on your way home. Tap it to send you a text in 30 minutes on your way to the laundry room so you don’t forget to go back. You could put one by your bed to toggle all of the lights in your house. The possibilities are endless.

I’d love to integrate with [IFTTT](http://ifttt.com) so it’s easy to get started if you don’t want to be nerdy. It’s just a button that you can make do whatever you want. Plain and simple.


## Transparency

I’m learning here. I have no idea what I’m doing when it comes to circuits. ==The software part is suddenly now that it controls the physical world.== Instead of keeping this to myself and one day releasing it as a big surprise, I’m going to remain open about all of this the entire time.

This isn’t a revolutionary idea. It’s ridiculously simple. ==This is the smallest hardware thing I can make and release.== I’m excited to go from there. Here’s the first demo:

If you want to follow along, I’ll be posting videos and such on [@thebuttonco](https://twitter.com/thebuttonco). You can also follow [@soffes](https://twitter.com/soffes) if you want.

Thanks for listening as I learn.
