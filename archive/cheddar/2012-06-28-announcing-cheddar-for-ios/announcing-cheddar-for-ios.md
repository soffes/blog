With Cheddar, your tasks are instantly everywhere. Everything you do with Cheddar pushes to all of your devices, so your world is always in sync. It’s really magical to create a task on your iPhone and have it instantly be on your computer without thinking about syncing.

It’s just text. Type in the box. Press return. Done. If you want to tag a task, use a hashtag just like you would on Twitter. You can also use Markdown for rich text in your tasks. [Learn more about Cheddar text features](https://cheddarapp.com/text).
