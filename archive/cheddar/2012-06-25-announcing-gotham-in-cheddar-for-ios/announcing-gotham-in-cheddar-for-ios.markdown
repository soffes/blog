We’re really proud to announce that Cheddar for iOS will feature [Gotham](http://www.typography.com/fonts/font_overview.php?productLineID=100008&path=head) by [H&FJ](http://typography.com). See a screenshot over [on Dribbble](https://dribbble.com/shots/618508-Cheddar-for-iOS-is-now-in-Gotham-by-H-FJ).

Since Cheddar puts a strong focus on text and [all the things you can do with it](https://cheddarapp.com/text), we thought it was really important to get a really amazing font for all of your text. Gotham is a really fantastic font by the folks over at H&FJ. We’re honored that they’ve agreed to license it to us. We only know of a few other apps in the App Store that are using it. We think you’ll really like it!

H&FJ assured us that they are still working on CSS embedding of fonts. For now, we will continue to use [Proxima Nova](http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/marksimonson/proxima-nova/) on the web until they get all that ready.
