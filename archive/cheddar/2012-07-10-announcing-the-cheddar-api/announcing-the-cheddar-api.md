# Announcing the Cheddar API

I’m really excited to announce that the Cheddar API is now available! We spent a lot of time making sure that developers had access to everything they needed to make a great app. I’m really proud to say that our full set of realtime APIs are public. Developers can use realtime APIs to make really great apps around Cheddar that feel just as fast as the official Cheddar apps.

==To learn more or get started, head over to [cheddarapp.com/developer](https://cheddarapp.com/developer).== I can’t wait to see what you’re going to build!
