# Announcing Cheddar for Mac Public Beta

I’m super happy to announce [Cheddar for Mac](https://cheddarapp.com/mac) is now in public beta. ==You can download it [here](https://cheddarapp.com/mac).==

There are a lot of things that need more work, but overall, I’m super happy with how it’s coming along so far. It was really important to me while planning Cheddar for Mac that it was actually a Mac app. I wanted it to feel like a Mac app instead of some silly hybrid app that doesn’t work that well. I’m really excited to say ==Cheddar for Mac is fully native.==

I had a lot of help with this from my friend [Indragie Karunaratne](http://indragie.com/). He has done a fantastic job executing some crazy stuff that I would have never thought possible. This is the first time I’ve had some full time help with Cheddar and I think that’s really exciting! Check Indragie out [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/indragie).

While in public beta, Cheddar for Mac will only be available to Cheddar Plus users. If you want to checkout Cheddar for Mac and aren’t a Cheddar Plus user, feel free to [download it](https://cheddarapp.com/mac) anyway. If you want to show your support and upgrade, I would deeply appreciate it. (There are [Cheddar shirts](https://cheddarapp.com/store) too by the way.)

Anyway, I hope you’re as excited as I am to start using Cheddar for Mac. If you like it, please spread the word!
