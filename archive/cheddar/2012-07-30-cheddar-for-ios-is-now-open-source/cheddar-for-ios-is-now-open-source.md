# Cheddar for iOS is Now Open Source

This is a big day for Cheddar! I’m super excited to announce Cheddar for iOS is now open source! ==You can see the code [on GitHub](https://github.com/nothingmagical/cheddar-ios).==

## Why open source?

Cheddar for iOS is open source since the app is free already. It is indended to be a source of sample code for everyone to benefit from. You can make cool apps that use Cheddar and I hopefully get more users because you built something awesome.

## Want to help make Cheddar great?

Since [it’s just one person behind Cheddar](/meet-the-man-behind-cheddar), getting help fixing bugs and such is also greatly appreciated.

Hopefully many more pieces of Cheddar will be open source. Cheddar for Mac will probably follow soon. Anyway, I can’t wait to hear what you think. Shoot [@cheddar](https://twitter.com/cheddar) a tweet or say hi [on Facebook](https://facebook.com/cheddarapp).
