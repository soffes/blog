# Announcing Cheddar for Mac!

Cheddar for Mac just hit the App Store. **[Download it for free on the Mac App Store!](https://itunes.apple.com/app/cheddar/id536464274)**

Cheddar for Mac has taken tons and tons of development hours. Mac development is a lot harder than iOS development so things take a lot longer.

I have a personal level of polish I like to maintain throughout Cheddar and frankly Cheddar for Mac is not up to that standard. I know a lot of you have been using the Cheddar for Mac beta (which was super buggy). This is a big improvement over that, but it still has a long way to go. Anyway, I figured it was best to ship it instead of polish forever. “Real artists ship."

To continue my commitment to bettering the community, ==[Cheddar for Mac is open source](https://github.com/nothingmagical/cheddar-mac)== just like [Cheddar for iOS](https://github.com/nothingmagical/cheddar-ios). If you see a problem and want to fix it, that would be amazing :)

Anyway, I hope you like Cheddar for Mac. If you enjoy it and feel it deserves 5 stars for helping you be more productive, love that it’s free and open source, or just want to make me smile, I would definitely appreciate a review.

Thanks again for all of your support. It truly means the world to me.

> I just noticed a silly bug that will case the Mac App Store to think Cheddar for Mac always needs an update even when it’s update to date. Sorry about that. I’m submitting 1.0.1 to fix that and a ton of other bugs this weekend.
