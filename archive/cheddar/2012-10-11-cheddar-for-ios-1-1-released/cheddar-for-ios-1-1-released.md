# Cheddar for iOS 1.1 Released!

Cheddar for iOS 1.1 just hit the App Store! There’s a ton of new stuff in this update. Here’s what’s new:

★ iPhone 5 & iOS 6 support

★ Full landscape support on iPhone

★ Extra keyboard keys to make typing tags and markdown easier

★ In-app browser for links

✔ Move tasks between lists (currently only on iPhone)

✔ URL scheme for use with other apps like LaunchCenter Pro

✔ TextExpander support

✔ Preference for font and text size

✔ Preference to make tapping a task do nothing, complete, or edit the task

✔ Support for filtering with multiple tags

✔ Remembers selected list across launches

✔ Finish adding tasks by pressing Go with an empty task

☂ Lots of bug fixes

Offline support and other great features will be coming in the next update! I’ve been working on offline support, but it wasn’t ready for primetime just yet. With the release of iPhone 5, I really wanted to get an update out for the new screen. Cheddar for iOS 1.2 is already shaping up. More on that soon.
