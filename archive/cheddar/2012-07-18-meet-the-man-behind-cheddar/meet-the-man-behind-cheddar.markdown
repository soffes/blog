title: Meet The Man Behind Cheddar
---

Hi everyone. I’m [Sam](http://soff.es). I make Cheddar. I’ve done all of the design (with a few small exceptions), development, support, marketing, etc. It’s just me.

Three months ago, I quit my job as the lead iOS engineer at [Hipstamatic](http://hipstamatic.com). I decided to set out on my own to make some products. (I recently did an [interview on Founders Talk](http://5by5.tv/founderstalk/38) if you want to know more about that sorta stuff.) Cheddar is the first of hopefully many cool things I plan on releasing.

Cheddar has been out for just over 2 weeks and tons of you have signed up and use Cheddar a lot. I can’t thank you enough. Especially those of you that have [Cheddar Plus](https://cheddarapp.com/account). Your support means so much to me. Seriously. Thank you.

If you need anything at all or just want to say hi, please don’t hesitate to email <support@cheddarapp.com>, tweet [@cheddar](https://twitter.com/cheddar), or call or text [(415) 294-1824](tel://+14152941824). I’m here to help.

Thanks for making my dream possible. You all are all seriously awesome. Thank you.

— Sam
