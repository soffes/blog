# Coins 1.0.1

Today [Coins](http://getcoinsapp.com) 1.0.1 was released! Here’s what’s new:

* Automatically refresh when you come back to the app
* Use 0 as the placeholder when entering your BTC
* Fix a few rounding bugs
* Added pull to refresh
* Larger text on iPad
* Fixed a bug that would prompt you to enter your BTC if you have less than one.

I’ve been working hard to knock out any bugs reported and add any features that don’t take away from Coins' simplicity.

Enjoy! Download Coins:
