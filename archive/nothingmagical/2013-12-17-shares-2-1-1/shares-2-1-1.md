# Shares 2.1.1

Today [Shares](http://useshares.com) 2.1.1 was released! Here’s what’s new:

* Greatly improved artwork system. Added artwork for several new companies.
* Added support for Berlin Stock Exchange, Stuttgart Stock Exchange, München Stock Exhange, Düsseldorf Stock Exhange, and OTC Markets
* Added localizations for Arabic, Danish, Dutch, French, German, Greek, Italian, Polish, Portuguese (Brazil), Russian, Slovenian, and Spanish (Spain)
* Added option to adjust the number of decimal places displayed. (Tap edit on the overview and then tap the gear icon.)
* Bug fixes

I’ve been working hard on improving Shares and knocking out feature requests. Several people in England requested the ability to show more decimal places since it’s common to trade there in pints instead of pounds.

I’m also super excited about the localizations. Tons of people helped localize Shares in just a matter of hours [on GitHub](https://github.com/nothingmagical/shares-l10n). Thanks to everyone that contributed! If you’d like to help, checkout the project [on GitHub](https://github.com/nothingmagical/shares-l10n).

Enjoy! Download Shares:
